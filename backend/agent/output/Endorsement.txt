Source: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012SCHEDULE A (Attached to and made a part of the Celebrity Endorsement Agreement dated March 14, 2012 by and between Bizzingo, Inc. and Joseph Theismann)   I Background   Bizzingo expects to populate its Network with Activated Users (as defined herein) through two distinct methods.   Method 1. (a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business name and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with specific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (“Seeded Profile”). As of the date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over 6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an “Activated User.”   (b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the Network, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded Profile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a user, that user will be deemed to be an “Activated User” and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User.   Method 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an Activated User and the Network will identify that user as an “Activated User.”   II Royalty and Initial Bonus   1. Royalty. The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users, respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-l and shall be referred to as the “Royalty Warrant."

Source: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/20122. Initial Bonus. Concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-II and shall be referred to as the “Bonus Warrant."   3. Restrictive Legend. The restricted legend for purposes of any certificate representing the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant, and the stock certificate for shares underlying the Royalty Warrant or Bonus Warrant is as follows:   
 
The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") or any state securities law. These shares have been acquired for investment and may not be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred, nor will any assignee or transferee thereof be recognized by the Company as having any interest in such shares, in the absence of(i) an effective registration statement with respect to the shares under the Act, and any other applicable state law, or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company that such shares will be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred only in a transaction which is exempt under or is otherwise in compliance with the applicable securities laws.   ***

may be coordinated with similar services for others entitled to the use of CELEBRITY’s personal services (e.g., if Service Days
include traveling to Las Vegas, Nevada, CELEBRITY and/or ABG may coordinate such Service Days to be performed during a
previously scheduled trip to Las Vegas, Nevada). PAPA JOHN’S shall provide local hair, make-up and/or wardrobe stylists for

CELEBRITY materially modifies the Required Disclosure provided by PAPA JOHN’S (i.e. if the Required Disclosure provided by PAPA JOHN’S
complied with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines, and ABG or CELEBRITY’s modification of the Required Disclosure causes such
Required Disclosure to not comply all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines).

subject to CELEBRITY’s prior personal and professional obligations, and further subject to advance scheduling
reasonable acceptable to ABG and CELEBRITY.

PAPA JOHN’S products or services (including, without limitation, Products) (e.g., either directly on any products or on any packaging therefor,
etc.). For purposes of this Agreement, “ Tie-In Program” shall be defined as any program or plan developed around a particular product or property

allocated and/or scheduled pursuant to the above (e.g., within a particular Contract Year), then: (A) the same shall not result in a reduction in any
amounts due and/or payable to ABG hereunder, and (B) PAPA JOHN’S shall be deemed to have waived its right to utilize those particular Services
(e.g., Service Days that are allocated for a particular Contract Year may not be carried into future Contract Years, or beyond the expiration or early
termination of the Term) without ABG’s Approval.
H. No Dangerous Activity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that CELEBRITY shall not be required to participate in
any physical activity during CELEBRITY’s performance of any Services hereunder that may be of a dangerous nature or which may involve a risk of
serious bodily injury to CELEBRITY and/or others, as determined by ABG and CELEBRITY in their collective sole and absolute discretion.
I. Additional Services. Personality’s rendition of additional services beyond the scope of the Services set forth herein
shall at all times be subject to the mutual agreement of the Parties (including, without limitation, the negotiation of appropriate remuneration in

more ‘Franchise Agreement’ pursuant to which, among other things, CELEBRITY (and/or CELEBRITY’S designee) will acquire a thirty percent
(30%) ownership in nine (9) Atlanta-area Papa John’s Pizza restaurants, and (ii) PAPA JOHN’S shall not, directly or indirectly, request, cause, or
require CELEBRITY, under or in connection with any such ‘Franchise Agreement’ or otherwise (except as expressly set forth in this Agreement), (a)

JOHN’S (including its designees) any right or license to use any of the Personality Rights. PAPA JOHN’S further acknowledges that ABG, as
successor in interest to CELEBRITY, is the sole and exclusive owner of a worldwide portfolio of Personality Rights, as well as other copyrights,
trademarks and other intellectual property rights related to CELEBRITY, and the rights of publicity, and other rights in and to the name, image,
likeness, persona, personality, voice, signature, and other indicia of, and rights of association and endorsement related to, CELEBRITY including,
without limitation, pursuant to Section 43(a) of the United States Lanham Act (collectively, the “Shaq Rights”). PAPA JOHN’S further
acknowledges and agrees that: (a) any and all use of the Shaq Rights and/or any intellectual property rights related to CELEBRITY (e.g. exploitation
of a copyrighted photograph of CELEBRITY), whether in connection with the Products or otherwise, requires the consent and authorization of
ABG in each instance, (b) ABG is the only person or entity that can authorize the use of Shaq Rights on or in connection with any products or
services throughout the world, and (C) should PAPA JOHN’s or any third party desire to manufacture, advertise, sell, offer or otherwise exploit any
products or services related to CELEBRITY, any and all such acts would be a use of the Shaq Rights and would therefore require the prior written
consent of ABG in each instance.
