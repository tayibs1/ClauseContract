C.   Sponsor is in the business of distributing certain online retail music
     merchandise and related content and maintains a Web site at

D.   Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite
     Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related
     content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to
     promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users.
Therefore, the parties agree as follows:
1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL
         a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of
                  the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will
                  not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional
                  buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for
                  any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except
                  those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by
                  any other Retail Music Store. "Retail Music Store" shall mean
                  any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music
                  Products at retail to consumers. "Music Products" 
   2
                                                                    CONFIDENTIAL
                 shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally
                 distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music
                 books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with
                 Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related
                 t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or
                 cybercast events).
                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available
                 opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products
                 from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not
                 available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into
                 arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music
                 Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies
                 Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor
                 thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available
                 through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that
                 certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired
                 Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)
                 days advance notice and will work together in good faith to
                 maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter
                 into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase
                 Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would
                 prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music
                 Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become
                 available through Sponsor.
         b)      The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and
                 will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement
                 Date. The "Commencement Date" means the date on which Excite
                 commences delivery of Impressions (defined below). The parties
                 anticipate the Commencement Date will be on or about October
                 15, 1997.
         c)      The parties' existing agreements regarding sponsorship of the
                 WebCrawler Web site (http://webcrawler.com) and all of the
                 existing advertising buys on the Excite Network will be
                 terminated as of the Commencement Date. Excite will credit
                 Sponsor in an amount equal to [****]. This credit will beapplied to reduce the first year exclusivity fee described in
                 Section 7(b) and will be reflected in a reduction of Sponsor's
                 December 31, 1997 payment to Excite described in Section 7(e).
         d)      Excite will offer Sponsor the right of first refusal to
                 negotiate with Excite for renewal of this sponsorship.

                                                                    CONFIDENTIAL
                  i) Excite will not propose, solicit or negotiate offers from
                  entities other than Sponsor for any retail music store
                  sponsorships of the Excite Site, if at all, until [****] prior
                  to the expiration of the term of this Agreement.
                  ii) Commencing not later than [****] prior to the expiration
                  of the term of the Agreement, Excite will negotiate with
                  Sponsor in good faith with respect to the terms and conditions
                  under which this Agreement would be renewed. Excite will
                  negotiate exclusively with Sponsor for the next [****] in good
                  faith effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship
                  renewal agreement. If, [****] prior to the expiration of the
                  term of the Agreement, the parties have not entered into a
                  written sponsorship renewal agreement. Excite may enter into
                  negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music
                  store sponsorships of the Excite Site.
                  iii) In the event that Excite intends to enter into an
                  agreement with a third party with respect to retail music
                  store sponsorships of the Excite Site before the expiration of
                  the term of the Agreement, Excite will deliver to Sponsor a
                  written notice describing the relevant opportunity. Although
                  Excite will not be required to disclose any information in
                  violation of any nondisclosure agreement between Excite and
                  any third party, the notice will include information
                  sufficient to permit Sponsor to evaluate the requirements for
                  meeting the competing offer for retail music store sponsorship
                  of the Excite Site and to formulate a meaningful response.
                  Sponsor will have [****] after receipt of such written notice
                  to provide notice to Excite that it is prepared to enter into
                  an agreement with Excite on the same terms and conditions as
                  Excite proposes to accept from such third party. Excite and
                  Sponsor will then promptly commence good faith negotiations to
                  conclude the agreement.
                  iv) If Sponsor rejects said offer or fails to notify Excite of
                  its acceptance within the [****] period, Excite shall have
                  the right thereafter to enter into the agreement with such
                  third party, provided the terms and conditions of the
                  agreement (if entered into within the subsequent ninety (90)
                  days) are not less favorable to Excite than previously offered
                  by Sponsor.

2.       IMPRESSIONS
         a)       "Impression" means any appearance of a link to the Sponsor
                  Site whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and
                  text. More than one Impression may appear on a page, except,
                  however, not more than three (3) Impressions per Channel page
                  will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of
                  these 3 Impressions, at least two (2) will link to pages in
                  the Sponsor Site offering Music Products; not more than two
                  (2) Impressions per generic search results page will count

                  Impressions, at least one (1) will link to pages in the
                  Sponsor Site offering Music Products; and no more than one (1)
                  Impression per specific search results page will count towards
                  delivery of guaranteed Impressions. In all events, Excite will
                  make a good faith effort to avoid duplicate Impressions on a
                  single page, but in no event will more than one (1)
                  Impression for the same artist on a Music Product page count
                  towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions. For the purposes
                  of this Agreement, "generic search results page" is an Excite
                  Search results page displayed in response to a query

                  to a query concerning a specific music artist or specific

                 mutually agreeable Impressions in the Excite Site designed to
                 provide content of interest (defined below) to Excite users
                 and/or promote the Sponsor Site, in numbers sufficient to meet
                 the Impression guarantees stated in Section 3.
         c)      Excite and Sponsor will collaborate on the design, appearance,
                 and placement (the "look and feel") of all Impressions. Excitewill have final approval over the look and feel of the
                 promotional Impressions, which approval will not be
                 unreasonably withheld.

                           three-month share of the applicable sponsorship fee
                           described in Sections 6(c) and 6(d) (each pro rata

                           three-month period exceeds the total of the Revenue
                           Floor applicable to the same three-month period,
                           Sponsor will pay Excite [****] of the gross margin
                           Sponsor realizes on the gross revenue amount equal to
                           the excess of the Total Revenue over the Revenue 
                           Floor during the three-month period.
                  iv)      If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the
                           three-month period does not exceed the Revenue Floor
                           applicable to the same three-month period, Sponsor
                           will not be obligated to pay Excite any share of the
                           gross revenue realized during the three-month period.
         g)       Payments of shared gross margin will be due to Excite within

         i)       Sponsor will maintain accurate records with respect to the
                  calculation of all payments due under this Agreement. Excite
                  may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice
                  to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant
                  to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the
                  calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business
                  hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in
                  connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless
                  the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less
                  than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in
                  which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the
                  reasonable fees for such inspection.

                  [****] following the first year end, Sponsor may terminate the
                  Agreement in accordance with Section 11 (b).
         b)       If Excite fails to deliver the guaranteed number of
                  Impressions on the Excite Site during the second year, Excite
                  will use commercially reasonable efforts to "make good" the
                  shortfall within [****] following the second year end.
                  However, the term of this Agreement will continue until Excite
                  has made good the guaranteed number of Impressions on the

                  sponsorship, advertising or exclusivity payments to Excite
                  during the "make good" period after the second year of the
                  Agreement, but Sponsor will continue to make revenue sharing
                  payments as described in Section 7(e). For the purposes of the
                  calculation of revenue sharing during this "make good" period
                  only, the "Revenue Floor" from the last quarter of the second
                  year of the term of the Agreement will apply.
         c)       Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party
                  materially breaches its obligations hereunder and such breach
                  remains uncured for thirty (30) days following the notice to
                  the breaching party of the breach, with the following
                  exceptions:

                           any such errors or outages as soon as reasonably
                           possible. In the event of three or more errors,
                           failures or outages of the Content or the Co-Branded
                           Area in any thirty (30) day period, Excite may elect

                           notice to Sponsor, unless Sponsor demonstrates to
                           Excite's reasonable satisfaction before theexpiration of the fifteen (15) day notice period that
                           the cause(s) of the errors, failures or outages have
                           been corrected; or
                  ii)      Sponsor will ensure that the Content will at all
                           times be at least substantially similar to any other
                           source of comparable topical content available on the
                           Internet in terms of the following factors, taken as
                           a whole: (i) breadth and depth of coverage, (ii)
                           timeliness of content updates and (iii) reputation
                           and ranking based on a cross-section of third party
                           reviewers in terms of features, functionality,
                           quality and other qualitative factors. In the event
                           that Sponsor fails to meet these quality criteria,
                           Excite may terminate this agreement on thirty (30)
                           days written notice and enter into an other
                           arrangements for the acquisition of similar content,
                           unless Sponsor demonstrates to Excite's reasonable
                           satisfaction before the expiration of the thirty (30)
                           day notice period that the deficiencies in the
                           Content have been corrected.
         d)       All payments that have accrued prior to the termination or
                  expiration of this Agreement will be payable in full within
                  thirty (30) days thereof.

                  (Warranty and Indemnity), Section 14 (Limitation of Liability)
                  and Section 15 (Dispute Resolution) will survive any
                  termination or expiration of this Agreement.

                  and advertising fees described in Section 5(b) and 5(c) until
                  the make-good is delivered, at which time NetGrocer will 
                  resume its payments of the sponsorship and advertising fees.
         h)       Excite will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
                  the Excite Network and display the promotional placements and

                  the removal of its advertising and promotional material from
                  the Excite Site.

         a)       Excite currently plans to develop a consumer packaged goods
                  ("CPG") program that would combine the broad reach of the
                  Excite Network with the depth of CPG merchants' industrycontacts and sales staffs. Under this program, Excite and
                  each CPG merchant would develop co-branded Web pages on the
                  Excite Network that would promote the merchant's goods cr
                  provide content of interest to Excite's users. Excite would
                  run dual promotional efforts, one that sends consumers to
                  each CPG merchant's co-branded area and a second that sends
                  consumers to the portion of the Excite Network that promotes
                  the entire CPG program. Excite and NetGrocer agree to
                  negotiate in good faith to establish the terms and conditions
                  for NetGrocer's participation in Excite's CPG program when
                  and if launched.
         b)       Excite currently plans to make available sponsorship
                  opportunities on its WebCrawler Site (located at
                  http://www.webcrawler.com) generally similar to the
                  opportunity described by this Agreement, with the significant
                  exception that merchants will not be granted category
                  exclusivity or rights to exclude competitors on the
                  WebCrawler Site. Excite and NetGrocer agree to negotiate in
                  good faith to establish the terms and conditions for
                  NetGrocer's participation in available sponsorship
                  opportunities on the WebCrawler Site when and if launched.

this 1st day of January, 1997, by and between HYDRON TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a New
York corporation with its principal offices located at 1001 Yamato Road, Suite
403, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, ("Hydron") and MIAMI DOLPHINS, LTD., a Florida
limited partnership with its principal offices located at 7500 Southwest 30th
Street, Davie, Florida 33314 ("Dolphins").
         WHEREAS, the Dolphins own and operate the Miami Dolphins, a
professional football team and member of the National Football League, which
presently is scheduled to play its home games at Pro Player Stadium in Miami,
Florida (the "Stadium"); and Hydron desires to be a sponsor of the Miami
Dolphins for certain entertainment and promotional purposes in connection with
the Miami Dolphins including its home games during the term of this Agreement;
and
         NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, Hydron and the Dolphins hereby agree as follows:
         1.       TERM OF AGREEMENT
                  1.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date
hereof and terminate upon the conclusion of the week following the conclusion of
the Dolphins 2000 regular season or post season, if applicable (the "Term" or
"Initial Term"). However, this Agreement may be earlier terminated in accordance
with the provisions hereof.
                  1.2 Hydron shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
upon written notice to Dolphins at any time between November 1, 1997 and
December 15, 1997, in which event this Agreement shall be terminated following
the Dolphins last 1997 regular or post-season game, if any. If Hydron does not
timely exercise its right to terminate this Agreement, then Hydron agrees that
this Agreement shall continue for the entire four (4) year term unless earlier
terminated pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement.
         2.       SPONSORSHIP RIGHTS
                  2.1 For the Term of this Agreement, the Dolphins will provide
Hydron with certain advertising and promotional benefits as are set forth in and
in accordance with Exhibit "A" attached hereto and made a part hereof (the
"Sponsorship Rights").
                  2.2 For the Term of this Agreement, Hydron shall be designated
as a sponsor of the Dolphins in the Sunscreen/Skin Care Category (as defined
below) and a licensee of the Marks (as defined below) in the Sunscreen/Skin
Category by the Dolphins. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Sunscreen/Skin Care Category" means the product category consisting of
sunscreen, sun protection and similar skin care products.
                  2.3 The Sponsorship Rights granted by the Dolphins to
Hydron are subject to 
termination in whole or in part at any time upon written notice to Hydron if
such Sponsorship Rights conflict with any exclusive advertising rights granted
by NFL Properties, Inc. to one of its advertisers or sponsors. In the event of
any such termination of exclusivity, the non-terminated Sponsorship Rights
granted to Hydron by the Dolphins shall nonetheless continue for the remainder
of the Term and the provisions of Section 8.2 shall apply. As of the date
hereof, the Dolphins have no knowledge of any claim by NFL Properties that the
Sponsorship Rights violate or conflict with exclusive rights granted by NFL
Properties.
         3.       CONSIDERATION
                  3.1 In consideration of the Sponsorship Rights granted to
Hydron hereunder:
                            (a) Hydron shall pay to the Dolphins an aggregate
amount of $96,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) as follows: Hydron
shall pay Dolphins the sum of $24,000 (plus any applicable sales and other
taxes) on July 1, 1997, July 1, 1998, July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000.
                  3.2 In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron
on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be
considered a material breach by Hydron, and the Dolphins may elect to charge
Hydron a late fee of 1.5% per month of the payment then due and owing until it
is paid in full. The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the
failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a five (5) business day
period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default
before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable
remedies. It is agreed by Hydron that any such election of remedies does not
waive any other remedies for breach of contract available to the Dolphins.
                  3.3 Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, including Exhibit "A", each of the parties shall pay its own expenses
of performing its obligations under this Agreement.4.       USE OF MARKS
                  4.1 Hydron and the Dolphins may use the name, logos, colors,
trademarks, service marks, or other identifying features ("Marks") of the other,
as specifically contemplated in connection with the Sponsorship Rights, subject
to any limitations set forth in this Agreement.
                  4.2 All advertising material and any use of the other parties'
Marks by a party is subject to the prior written approval of the Mark owner.
Either party shall submit all such materials or proposed usage of a Mark to the
other party at least two weeks prior to its intended use. The Mark owner shall
have the right to inspect and require changes or deletions (including the right
to disapprove of such advertisement or use of Marks in their entirety) of
advertising and promotional copy or material that the Mark owner may deem to be
contrary to its policies or best interests. Such requirements will not be
unreasonably imposed, and the foregoing approvals and
                                        2
requirements will be consistently given and imposed on all sponsors or users of
the Marks, as the case may be.
                  4.3 Any and all public announcements or press releases by or
on behalf of the other party regarding the Sponsorship Rights or the details of
this Agreement shall be subject to the consent of the other party, and each
party shall have the right to approve in advance the contents and timing
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dolphins acknowledge that Hydron, as
a publicly held company, has disclosure obligations pursuant to the federal
securities laws. Hydron agrees to take the comments of the Dolphins into account
in preparing and disseminating such disclosure, but notwithstanding comments
from the Dolphins, Hydron shall make such disclosure as may be required by law.
                  4.4 For purposes of this Agreement, the Dolphins and Hydron
expressly recognize that the Marks are the unique, valid and exclusive property
of the respective owner of the Mark. The Dolphins and Hydron agree that they
shall not, either during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, directly or
indirectly, contest the validity of the other's Marks or any of the
registrations pertaining thereto, in the United States or elsewhere, nor adopt
the other's Marks or any term, word, mark or designation which is in any aspect
confusingly similar to the other's Marks. The Dolphins and Hydron specifically
acknowledges that any use of the Marks pursuant to this Agreement shall not
create for the Dolphins or Hydron any right, title or interest in the other's
Marks. The Dolphins and Hydron further agree that they will not at any time do
or cause to be done any act or thing, directly or indirectly, which contests or
in any way impairs or tends to impair any part of the right, title and interest
of the other in its Marks; and the Dolphins and Hydron shall not, in any manner,
represent that it has any ownership interest in the other's Marks or the
registrations therefor. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Dolphins and
Hydron shall immediately terminate all use of the other's Marks.
                  4.5 Hydron expressly recognizes that the Dolphins have
previously granted the exclusive rights to license and sublicense its Marks to
NFL Properties, Inc., and that the grant to Hydron of the right to use the Marks
is subject to the prior approval of NFL Properties, Inc. In the event that such
approval is not so given by NFL Properties, Inc., then such usage rights of
Hydron shall immediately terminate. The Dolphins represent that they will use
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of NFL Properties, Inc. to the
execution and performance of this Agreement prior to their execution hereof. In
any such event, the provisions of Section 8.2 will apply.
         5.       STADIUM POLICY; GOVERNING LEAGUE POLICIES
                  5.1 Hydron and the Dolphins agree that this Agreement shall be
performed in accordance with rules and policies of the Stadium as may be
applicable to this Agreement, if any. The Dolphins will advise Hydron of any
development of or changes in these rules and policies that might adversely
affect the terms of this Agreement.
                  5.2 The parties agree that this Agreement shall automatically
be subject to any new or amended National Football League (the "NFL") rules or
regulations applicable to advertising or promotional benefits provided by NFL
member teams to its sponsors effective as
                                        3
of the date such regulation shall take effect and that this Agreement shall
incorporate and be subject to the Constitution, By-Laws, rules and regulations,
the duly authorized resolutions of the governing body, the decrees and rulings
of the commissioner and the terms and conditions of any and all agreements to
which the NFL is a party and as to which the NFL has bound its member clubs
(collectively all of such regulations, resolutions, decrees and agreements are
referred to as the "Governing League Policies"). The Dolphins shall advise
Hydron of any changes therein which may materially and adversely affect the
Sponsorship Rights. As of the date hereof, the Dolphins have no knowledge of any
claim by the NFL that the Sponsorship Rights violate any Governing League Rules.
                  5.3 Without limiting any other potential uses of the Dolphins'
Marks, Hydron agrees that the Dolphins may allow or authorize any League Sponsor
(as defined below) to engage in advertising and promotional activities in the
Dolphins' local market (including, without limitation, the Stadium), orotherwise provide benefits to such League Sponsor, if such League Sponsor is
entitled to engage in such activities or receive such benefits pursuant to any
sponsorship or promotional licensing arrangement now or hereafter entered into
between such League Sponsor and the NFL or any of its affiliates (including,
without limitation, NFL Properties, Inc., NFL Enterprises, Inc. and NFL Films,
Inc.). For purposes of this Agreement the term, "League Sponsor" shall mean any
person or entity which currently is, or at any time becomes a sponsor or
promotional licensee of or with respect to any NFL event or program now or
hereafter in existence. By way of illustration only and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, League Sponsors may place advertising and
promotional materials (including displays) in the Stadium, in connection with a
League event, such as the Super Bowl.
                  5.4 If any rule or regulation of the Stadium, or any Governing
League Policy as described in Sections 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 requires the termination
or revision of any Sponsorship Right, such Sponsorship Right shall be revised or
terminated upon written notice to Hydron and the provisions of Section 8.2 shall
apply to such termination or revisions.

Pre-Acceptance Period. If and to the extent any such decision would or could (or would or could be reasonably foreseeable to) adversely affect any Sponsor in any manner, each decision to be made by or on behalf of Purchaser with respect to the Offer (or any similar transaction), any agreements related thereto ("Related Agreements"), or any transaction contemplated by the Offer or any Related Agreement ("Contemplated Transactions" and, together with the Offer and Related Agreements, "Offer Matters"), or any Offer Matter or combination of Offer Matters, in any case, on and from the Effective Date and until the Acceptance Time ("Pre-Acceptance Period") shall require the unanimous consent of the Sponsors, including, without limitation, any (a) announcement of intention, commencement, amendment, supplement, termination, extension, modification, or waiver of or related to the Offer or any term or condition thereof, including, without limitation, with respect to any commencement date, initial offering period, offer price, type or form of consideration to be offered or paid, timing or other term of acceptance for payment or payment of any subject security, withdrawal right, expiration date, subsequent offering period, or top-up option, (b) waiver of any condition to or of the Offer or determination as to whether or not any such condition has been, is, or will be satisfied, (c) filing, dissemination, or disclosure requirement or offering document or tender offer material, including, without limitation, with respect to any filing or exhibit, schedule, attachment, amendment, or supplement thereto, (d) agreement, instrument, document, or matter related to any borrowing, incurrence of indebtedness, or equity, debt, or other financing, (e) litigation or other legal proceeding, including, without limitation, with respect to any stockholder list or security holder listing or poison pill, rights plan, or similar right, or derivative or other litigation or legal proceeding related to the Company's capitalization, (f) designation, nomination, appointment, or election of any person as a member of the board of directors of the Company, or (g) agreement, arrangement, or understanding with the Company or any manager, director, officer, employee, stockholder, partner, affiliate, associate, or related party of the Company.   
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO - July 16, 2012 Exhibit (d)(i) Sponsorship Agreement - July 16, 20122. Equity Commitments. Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor is bound by and has complied with, and agrees that such Sponsor shall continue to be bound by and comply with, the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) shall be entitled to enforce, or direct the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this Agreement if and only if the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have determined by unanimous written consent that the conditions of the Offer have been satisfied or to waive all such conditions remaining unsatisfied. No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).   3. Defaulting and Participating Sponsors. Each Sponsor that has complied with the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement ("Participating Sponsor") may terminate the participation in the Offer of any Sponsor that has not satisfied the funding requirementscontemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise failed to comply with the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement ("Defaulting Sponsor"); provided, however, that such termination shall not affect any right of any Participating Sponsor as against such Defaulting Sponsor with respect to such failure to fund or any such other non-compliance. If the Participating Sponsors unanimously consent to proceed (and whether or not any Participating Sponsor elects to seek specific performance as against any Defaulting Sponsor in connection herewith), the amount of the commitment of each Defaulting Sponsor shall be offered, first, to the Participating Sponsors pro rata (based on the commitments of such Participating Sponsors), and, thereafter, as applicable, to one or more other co-investors, unanimously approved by the Participating Sponsors. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the time any Sponsor becomes a Defaulting Sponsor, the approval or consent of such Defaulting Sponsor shall not be required for any purpose hereunder; provided, however, that each Defaulting Sponsor that ultimately participates in the Offer (as a result of any Participating Sponsor electing to seek specific performance as against such Defaulting Sponsor) shall cease to be a "Defaulting Sponsor" and shall have approval and consent rights hereunder.   4. Transfer Restrictions. During the Pre-Acceptance Period, no Sponsor shall transfer any portion of the Commitment or any interest in Purchaser ("Unit") other than to any investment fund affiliated with such Sponsor; provided, however, that no such transfer shall relieve such Sponsor of any corresponding or other portion of any obligation of such Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter or hereunder unless and until such fund: (a) has committed equity or similar available capital in amounts sufficient to satisfy such obligation; (b) executes and delivers to Purchaser an appropriate equity commitment letter, a joinder signature page to this Agreement, and each other document reasonably requested by Purchaser (collectively, the "New Sponsor Documents") and agrees to be bound hereby as a "Sponsor" hereunder; (c) certifies to each Party that such fund is capable of performing the obligations of such fund under each such New Sponsor Document; and (d) is approved by each non-transferring Participating Sponsor, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.   5. Interim Period and Continuing Sponsors. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into at or prior to the Acceptance Time: (a) an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Purchaser ("Purchaser LLC Agreement"); and (b) one or more definitive agreements with the Participating Sponsors (collectively, "Security Holder Agreements") providing for the unanimous consent of the Continuing Sponsors with respect to all decisions to be made by or on behalf of Purchaser with respect to any Offer Matter or the Company or any security issued or to be issued by the Company during the period on and from the Acceptance Date and until the time there ceases to be at least two Continuing Sponsors ("Interim Period"), including without limitation, any matter described in or contemplated by Section 1 hereof. For purposes hereof, "Continuing Sponsor" shall mean and refer to each Participating Sponsor that becomes a member of Purchaser and a party to the Purchaser LLC Agreement and Security Holder Agreements (collectively, the "Management-Ownership Agreements"), in each case, as long as such Sponsor continues to be a member of Purchaser and comply with the Management-Ownership Agreements.   6. Voting Agreements. Purchaser shall (and each Sponsor shall cause each Unit owned by such Sponsor, if any, to be voted to cause Purchaser to) authorize, issue, sell, or exchange, as applicable, Units to Participating Sponsors pro rata (based on the Commitments of Participating Sponsors) and otherwise in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters and this Agreement; provided, however, that each Unit of any class or series shall be issued at the same price(s) and in the same proportion(s) as all other Units of such class or series.   
 
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO - July 16, 2012 Exhibit (d)(i) Sponsorship Agreement - July 16, 20127. Distribution, Redemption, and Other Transfer Rights.

Termination Fee. An amount equal to any termination or similar fee received by Purchaser, including, without limitation, any such fee paid by the Company or any affiliate, associate, or related party of the Company pursuant to a merger agreement or otherwise, or portion thereof remaining after making or confirming adequate provisions for the payment or reimbursement of Transaction Costs, shall be promptly distributed or otherwise paid to the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) or their designees, in any case, pro rata (based on the Commitments or Units of such Sponsors, as applicable).   9.

publicity with respect to the Driver and the Racing Team, SRP shall be
responsible for the public image of the Driver and the Racing Team at all times,
including but not limited to any statement by the Driver or the Team in
connection with press conferences, media contact and any contact of the Driver

maximum of 12 personnel and a driver suit for the Driver. Consistent with the
NASCAR rules and regulations, and excluding any patches required by NASCAR,

and Driver's suit on the areas depicted on Exhibit A to this Agreement. Logan's
also shall have the exclusive right to promote its Logan's trademark on the side

NASCAR and race track rules, regulations and procedures, SRP will use best
efforts to secure credentials for the pre-race admissions of a maximum of four
designees of Logan's to pit row and/or the garage area of each regularly
scheduled or special LMSC event in which the Race Car competes.
                  (G) SHOW CAR. SRP will build and provide to Logan's a 1997
Ford Thunderbird automobile ("Show Car") that will have an appearance identical
to 
                                       2
   3
that of the race car, to include full roll cage, race interior, paint, graphics
and under-hood race look. Logan's will provide equipment and driver to transport
the Show Car to destinations and according to schedules as determined by
Logan's. At the expiration of this contract, Logan's will return the Show Car to
SRP in substantially the same condition as when received by Logan's, normal wear
and tear excepted.
            (H) TRANSPORTER. SRP is attempting to purchase or lease a 53 foot 
semi-trailer to be pulled by a Peterbilt class eight tractor which will function

racing graphics by SRP up to a maximum cost allowance of Two Thousand Five
Hundred and No/100's ($2,500.00), with Logan's retaining the right to apply more
extensive graphics at its own expense if Logan's so chooses. Any associate
sponsor graphics appearing on the Transporter will be displayed in a subservient
manner to clearly reflect Logan's as the primary sponsor of the Team.

to grant all rights to Baker under this Article 3.
         4. ASSOCIATE AND SECONDARY SPONSORSHIPS. SRP shall have the right to
obtain secondary and associate sponsors for the Race Car and Team, subject to
the approval of Logan's, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. SRP
may not obtain any associate or secondary sponsors whose products or concepts
compete with Logan's. Any associate and/or secondary sponsor may promote its
role as a sponsor by signage, logos or trademarks on the Race Car, provided that
such associate and/or secondary sponsors signage, logos or trademarks used on
the Race Car, when viewed collectively, shall not cover any area greater than
25% of that of Logan's signage, logos or trademarks, nor conflict with the
graphic design, or in other locations or on clothing as may be permitted by the
terms of the Agreement. Logan's shall have the exclusive use of the hood, the
rear quarter panel area above the tire and the bottom of the deck lid (rear
facing panel, TV panel) of the Race Car, as shown on Exhibit C to this

trademarks and the "spoiler space" are reserved for NASCAR, SRP and the
associate and secondary sponsors. All associate and secondary sponsors' graphic
layouts for the Race Car are subject to Logan's approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, SRP shall not permit any associate or
secondary sponsor to suggest in any manner that its sponsorship role is as great
as that of Logan's.
         5. CONTINGENT SPONSORS. SRP intends to participate in NASCAR and NMS
decal sponsor programs such as a series sponsor, and race related products such
as tires and fuel. Logan's acknowledges that NASCAR or NMS require the placing
of certain decals on the Race Car as a prerequisite for competing in a racing
event. SRP acknowledges that such required decals shall be placed forward of the
                                       3
   4
door panel, or as otherwise required by NASCAR rules and regulations, in a way

confidentiality of any information exchanged between them as a result of this
Agreement, including information exchanged during the negotiation of this
Agreement, and shall not use such information to the disadvantage of the other

sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, iVillage and FMM hereby agree as
follows:
1.       Term and Termination.
         A. Term. The initial production period shall be for a period of two (2)
months to commence on November 4, 1998 (the "Production Period"), and the
remaining term of this Agreement shall be for a period of twenty four (24)
months to commence on the tentative launch date of January 4, 1999, unless

terms set forth in a proposal (the "Proposal) to be presented to FMM. FMM shall
indicate its acceptance or rejection of the Proposal no later than August 31,
2000. If iVillage does not receive FMM's acceptance or rejection of the Proposal

         B. Termination. In the event of a material breach by either Party of
any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement

All such  payments  due  hereunder  shall be payable on or before the 5th of the
month in which such payment  becomes due. In the event XC voluntarily  withdraws

(the  "Lock-Up"),  and AJR agrees to be bound by the  Lock-Up.  Pursuant  to the
Lock-Up,  AJR agrees that following the registration of Registrable  Securities,
it shall not directly or  indirectly,  sell,  transfer,  pledge,  assign,  gift,
hypothecate  or  otherwise  dispose of more than 25,000  shares of Common  Stock

exchange or securities market where XC's Common Stock is then traded.
     4. Accredited Investor Representations.  In order to induce XC to issue the
Shares and the  Warrants to AJR,  AJR hereby  represents  and  warrants to XC as
follows:
          (a) AJR is aware of what constitutes an "accredited  investor" as that
term is defined under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the  "Securities  Act"), and under applicable state securities laws,
and AJR represents and warrants that is an "accredited investor" for purposes of
Regulation D and such state securities laws.
          (b) AJR acknowledges that an investment in the Shares and the Warrants
is a  speculative  investment  and  involves a high degree of risk,  and that XC
makes no assurances  whatsoever  concerning the present or prospective  value of
the  Shares  or the  Warrants.  AJR is able to bear  the  economic  risks  of an
investment in the Shares and the Warrants,  and, consequently,  without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, is able to hold the Shares and the Warrants for
an indefinite period of time and has a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of
its entire  investment  in the Shares and the  Warrants in the event such a loss
should occur.
          (c) AJR has had an opportunity to review copies of XC's public filings
with  the  United  States   Securities  and  Exchange   Commission  (the  "SEC")
(collectively,  the "Public  Documents").  AJR has had the opportunity to obtain
any additional  information  necessary to verify the accuracy of the information
contained in the Public  Documents  and has been given the  opportunity  to meet
with representatives of XC and to have them answer any questions and
                                      -4-
provide any  additional  information  considered  relevant by AJR. In making its

Services from NCB or NPC ("Merchants") and (ii) to enter into contracts with
merchants ("Merchant Contracts") for the provision of Merchant Processing
Services as agent of NCB; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit

purpose of receiving all settlement amounts paid by Visa and MasterCard with

effecting appropriate payments to the Merchants and NPC in accordance with this
Agreement ("the NCB Account").

                  (a) PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS. NPC shall prepare and transmit to
         NCB, in a mutually acceptable format, instructions specifying the
         payments to be made from the NCB Account to the Merchants and to NPC

         shall pay the Merchants on a timely basis the net settlement amounts
         due to them and shall credit NPC's account at NCB for the fees due to
         NPC hereunder. Such payments to Merchants shall be effected through
         mutually acceptable procedures which are consistent with the payment
         procedures established pursuant to the Merchant Contracts. NPC shall
         perform on NCB's behalf all of the administrative and bookkeeping
         functions necessary to effect payment in such manner.
                  1.7 DUE DILIGENCE BY NCB; NPC'S STANDARDS.
                  (a) DUE DILIGENCE PRIOR TO EXECUTION OF AGREEMENT. Senior
         management officials of NPC have met with senior management officials
         of NCB and have discussed with the NCB officials the credit and
         financial review procedures and standards used by NPC in deciding
         whether to accept or retain Merchants as customers for Merchant
         Processing Services, as well as NPC's experience with respect to any
         losses resulting from financial failures or fraud by its merchant
         customers. Schedule A attached hereto outlines the credit and financial
         review procedures and standards currently used by NPC. NPC represents
                                       2
   3
         to NCB, and has provided NCB's senior management with financial
         information showing, that for 1994 and 1995 combined, the losses
         incurred by NPC as a result of financial failures or fraud by its
         merchant customers have averaged less than .60% of NPC's net revenues
         from Merchant Processing Services.
                  (b) CONTINUING DUE DILIGENCE: NPC'S RISK STANDARDS. NPC shall
         keep NCB's senior management advised of any material changes in the
         credit and financial review procedures and standards and of any
         material exceptions to such procedures and standards which may from
         time to time be made with respect to particular Merchants. NPC shall
         not make any such changes or exceptions until its management committee
         has approved such changes or exceptions after carefully evaluating the
         relative advantages and disadvantages expected to result from such
         changes or exceptions. NPC also shall continue to advise senior
         management officials of NCB on a timely basis with respect to any
         substantial loss (meaning any loss of $1,000,000 or more with respect
         to a single Merchant or $3,000,000 or more in the aggregate in any
         twelve month period) incurred by NPC as a result of any financial
         failures or fraud by its merchant customers. If NCB's senior management
         officials reasonably determine from time to time that any changes are
         needed in NPC's credit and financial review procedures and standards or
         in the implementation thereof in order to avoid any significant
         increase in NPC's losses from financial failures or fraud by its
         merchant customers, then NCB shall so notify NPC in writing, and NPC
         and NCB shall mutually agree upon, and NPC shall implement appropriate
         changes.
                  (c) DUE DILIGENCE BY NCB FOR NPC PRICING STANDARDS. Senior
         management officials of NPC have met with senior management officials
         of NCB and have discussed with the NCB officials the pricing procedures
         and standards used for Merchants as customers for Merchant Processing
         Services. NPC shall keep NCB's senior management advised of anymaterial changes in its pricing procedures and standards and of any
         material exceptions to such procedures and standards which may from
         time to time be made with respect to particular Merchants. NPC shall
         not make any such changes or exceptions until its management committee
         has approved such changes or exceptions after carefully evaluating the
         relative advantages and disadvantages expected to result from such
         changes or exceptions. If NCB's senior management officials reasonably
         determine from time to time that any changes are needed in NPC's
         pricing procedures and standards or in the implementation thereof, then
         NCB shall so notify NPC in writing, and NPC and NCB shall mutually
         agree upon, and NPC shall implement appropriate changes.

representative those meetings for members of Visa and MasterCard which relate to
Merchant Processing Services, to maintain on behalf of NCB copies of all
Merchant Contracts to which NCB is a party, to act generally as the NCB

   4
as may be designated by NCB, advised of all material, non-routine actions taken
on behalf of NCB by any of the Joint Officers and shall consult in advance with

shall have no obligation to compensate any of the Joint Officers.

                         ------------------------------
                  3.1 MERCHANT PROCESSING - BANKING SERVICES. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Date NPC shall enter into agreements or make
other mutually acceptable arrangements with NCB pursuant to which NCB will
provide those banking services which are necessary for NPC to provide the
Merchant Processing Services and which the parties wish NCB to provide.
                  3.2 AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH BANK ACCOUNTS. Each Joint Officer
shall have authority to establish at NCB or any other mutually acceptable
financial institution any deposit accounts on behalf of NCB as may be necessary
to provide some or all of the Merchant Processing Services contemplated by this
Agreement for such periods as NCB and NPC agree. No provision of this Agreement
authorizes or shall be construed to authorize any Joint Officer or NPC to incur

       its terms, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay expenses,
       charges and other amounts in accordance with the provisions of this
       Agreement,
                                       4

         Agreement,
including, but not limited to, all court costs, investigation expenses and the
reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel for NCB selected by NCB,

                      -------------------------------------
                  6.1 COMPLIANCE MODIFICATIONS. In the event that:
                  (a) the laws, rules and/or regulations or any official
      interpretations thereof applicable to NCB as a National Bank or the Visa
      or MasterCard rules and/or regulations or any official interpretations
      thereof applicable to NCB and the matters covered by this Agreement are
      modified such that
                         (i) any modifications in the relationship or
              transactions contemplated hereby between NCB and NPC or in the
              provisions of this Agreement are needed to comply with any such
              laws, rules, regulations or official interpretations thereof, or
                         (ii) some or all of the activities contemplated by this
              Agreement are prohibited, or
                  (b) Visa or MasterCard requires, as a condition to performance
       of this Agreement, that NPC enter into an agreement with Visa or
       MasterCard that NPC considers unacceptable,
then at NPC's request, NCB will cooperate in making any modifications to this
Agreement and to the parties' relationship hereunder to the extent any such
modifications will permit NPC to continue processing, settling and authorizing
bankcard transactions (or continue performing some of such functions) in
compliance with the laws, rules, regulations or any official interpretations
thereof applicable to NCB as a National Bank and the Visa and MasterCard rules,
regulations, and interpretations thereof and any contractual terms required by
Visa or MasterCard and acceptable to NPC (any such modifications being referred
to as "Compliance Modifications") provided that such Compliance Modifications
are reasonable and are not unduly burdensome to NCB, and NPC reimburses NCB for
any additional costs reasonably incurred by NCB in connection with such
Compliance Modifications.
                  6.2 FAILURE TO MAKE COMPLIANCE MODIFICATION. If NPC does not
request any Compliance Modifications or the parties cannot agree upon the terms
of any Compliance Modifications, then either party may terminate this Agreement
upon prior written notice to the other party effective at the later of: (a) the
deadline imposed by Visa or MasterCard for complying with any such rule,
regulation, official interpretation or contract requirement or (b) 120 days
after actual notice to NPC of such rule, regulation, interpretation or contract
requirement.

         agreement with an ISO/MSP which maintains merchant customers engaged in
         such businesses.

         completed by NPC before a Merchant is accepted as a new customer. These
         procedures may be repeated with respect to any existing Merchant
         customer if such Merchant has unusual credit card activity, unusual or
         higher than normal chargebacks, or if other circumstances arise which,
         in the judgment of NPC's management, warrant a new or on-going credit
         review.
         - Inquire against Terminated Merchant File
         - Obtain and Review Personal Credit Reports on Principal(s) (when
           applicable)

located at 555 Broadway, Redwood City, California 94063 ("Excite"), and Vitamin

Avenue, North Bergen, New Jersey 07047 ("Client").
                                    RECITALS
A.               Excite maintains sites on the Internet at
                 http://www.excite.com (the "Excite Site"),
                 http://www.webcrawler.com (the "WebCrawler Site) and
                 http://www.excite.co.jp (the "Excite Japan Site"), and owns,
                 manages or is authorized to place advertising on affiliated
                 sites on the Internet worldwide (collectively, the "Excite
                 Network") which, among other things, allow its users to search
                 for and access content and other sites on the Internet.  For
                 purposes of this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge
                 that the Excite Network does not include the site on the
                 Internet located at http://home.netscape.com and/or other URLs
                 or locations designated by Netscape Communications
                 Corporation.
B.               Within the Excite Site and the WebCrawler Site, Excite
                 currently organizes certain content into topical channels (the
                 "Channels").
C.               Client is engaged in the business of selling vitamins,
                 minerals, nutritional supplements, herbs, sports nutrition
                 formulae, homeopathic remedies and other health related
                 products ("Vitamins") at its site on the Internet located at
                 http://www.vitaminshoppe.com (the "Client Site").
D.               Client wishes to promote its business to users of the Excite
                 Network through promotions and advertising in various portions
                 of the Excite Network.
Therefore, the parties agree as follows:
1.               SPONSORSHIP ON THE WEBCRAWLER HEALTH CHANNEL
                 a)       Client will be promoted as the preferred and dominant
                          reseller of Vitamins in the Health Channel on the
                          WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. As
                          such, Excite may not display banner advertising and/or
                          promotional placements for any of Client's Competitors
                          that are, in the aggregate, of equal or greater
                          prominence and exposure than the aggregate of Client's
                          links, advertising banners and promotional placements
                          on the pages of the Health Channel on the WebCrawler
                          Site during the term of this Agreement. For purposes
                          of this Agreement, Client's Competitors means those
                          merchants identified in Exhibit D attached hereto.

                          banners and promotional placements displayed on the
                          Excite Network.
                 f)       As soon as such third party auditing is available to
                          Excite, Excite will provide Client with monthly
                          reports, including certified reports by a third party

                          made to Excite are determined to have been less than
                          ninety-five percent (95%) of the payments actually
                          owed to Excite, in which case Client will be
                          responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees

                          Agreement will begin on the Launch Date and will not
                          end until Excite displays a total of [*****]

                          B.  Regardless of Excite's actual delivery of
                          impressions, the term of this Agreement will not be
                          shorter than [*****]  after the Launch Date,
                          unless the Agreement is terminated earlier in
                          accordance with the specific terms of this Agreement.
                 b)       Either party may terminate this Agreement if the
                          other party materially breaches its obligations
                          hereunder and such breach remains uncured for thirty
                          (30) days following the notice to the breaching party
                          of the breach.
                 c)       All undisputed payments that have accrued prior to
                          the termination or expiration of this Agreement will
                          be payable in full within thirty (30) days thereof.
                 d)       The provisions of Section 12 (Confidentiality and
                          User Data), Section 13 (Indemnity), Section 14

                          Resolution) will survive any termination or
                          expiration of this Agreement.
                 e)       Excite guarantees to deliver the annual impressions
                          totals set forth in Exhibit C hereto.  If Excite
                          fails to deliver the indicated number of impressions
                          required during any annual period, Client may suspend
                          (but not eliminate) its payments specified in Section
                          7 for a maximum of sixty (60) days (the "Make-Good
                          Period) during which Excite will deliver the
                          shortfall of such impressions.  The parties agree to
                          cooperate in good faith to evaluate the quality and
                          performance of the placements used to deliver the
                          impressions during the Make-Good Period.  Until such
                          shortfall is delivered, no impressions will be deemed
                          delivered for the next annual period.  If Excite has
                          not achieved the required annual impression delivery
                          by the end of the Make-Good Period, Client may then

                          negotiation, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to

                          arising from or concerning in any manner the subject
                          matter of this Agreement, other than disputes arising

                          resolved through good faith negotiation and

AD MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT & OPTIMIZATION
Ad Management, Measurement and Optimization refers to the suite of services and
technologies to be used to measure and evaluate variables contributing to the
performance of client marketing messages within the Excite Network.
Descriptions of the services and technologies to be leveraged throughout theoptimization process are highlighted below.
CENTRALIZED AD SERVING
Through its proprietary centralized ad serving infrastructure, MatchLogic will
facilitate the trafficking, delivery, tracking and reporting of Client's
banners throughout the Excite Network.  During the ad management process,
MatchLogic will employ TrueCount(sm) cache counting techniques as the
underlying measurement technology for the reporting of client campaign
performance data.  Basic campaign performance data including primary
impressions, clicks, click %, cache impressions and total impressions will be
supplied to Client daily through an online interface.
TRUEFFECT(sm)
TruEffect(sm) refers to the process of establishing, tracking and communicating
the relationship between locations from which users have interacted with
Client's marketing messages and the activities they engaged in at the Client
Site as a result of these interactions.  TruEffect(sm) measurement will allow
Client to directly relate user activity within the Client Site to marketing
messages within the Excite Network.  As a result of these measurements, Client
will have the ability to optimize campaigns in order to drive actual user
activities or transactions.  Client will be able to identify the number of
unique visitors coming to the Client Site or promotional areas, from which
message and area they originated, and the number of measurable transactions
these visitors performed.  Additionally, measurements of reach and frequency
will accompany this analysis.
Upon successful implementation of TruEffect(sm), performance reporting will be
available to Client on a daily basis through an online interface.
LANDSCAPE(sm)
LandscapE(sm) demographic profile reports will afford Client an effective means
of understanding the visitor segments exposed to Client's messages or
interacting with Client sponsored content areas within the Excite Network.  All
of the information contained within the demographic profiles is derived from
consumers who have been both exposed to an advertising campaign and are also
within MatchLogic's Digital 1:1(sm) database (MatchLogic's proprietary consumer
database).  When a subset of unique visitors taken from all visitors exposed to
a Client's marketing message or content area are matched against the Digital
1:1(sm) database, demographic profiles are derived.  The matched records create
a sample of visitors that are used to demographically represent and
statistically profile

each visitor segment.  These profiles will allow Client to compare its
understanding of its customers offline to its customers online as a basis for
more effective segmenting and future targeting.
LandscapE(sm) reports are generated on a campaign basis and will include
measurements of campaign reach by Age, Gender, Age/Gender, Household Income,
and Household Income/Age.  These reports will be made available to Client once
statistically significant profiles have been established.
TRUESELECT(sm)
TrueSelect(sm) is MatchLogic's centralized advertising targeting system.
TrueSelect(sm) enables MatchLogic to project demographics of users across the
Internet based on our Digital 1:1 database, user traffic and user search
patterns.  The first implementation of this technology will be Virtual Keywords
slated for release in 4Q98.  Virtual Keywords will allow MatchLogic to actively
target a user on the Excite Network based on the user's input of search terms
at a previous point in time.  TrueSelect(sm) will be able to track and target
users by Virtual Keywords on both an inter-day and intra-day basis.  Following
Virtual Keywords, TrueSelect(sm) capabilities will enable marketers to actively
target specific users based on predetermined demographic or lifestyle
information in real time.
Upon release of this technology, delivery of TrueSelect(sm) targeted messaging
for Client is highly dependent on a number of qualifying criteria.  A critical
qualifier for the implementation of TrueSelect(sm) will be the establishment of
a significant behavioral profile target for Client's customers as highlighted
within the LandscapE(sm) services description above.
DELIVERE(sm)
DeliverE(sm), MatchLogic's email marketing service will be leveraged to deliver
email marketing campaigns on behalf of Vitamin Shoppe.  The DeliverE(sm) team
will consult with Client to evaluate current business objectives (branding,
acquisition, retention, reactivation, etc.) and develop e-mail strategies that
meet these specific objectives.  Once appropriate strategies have been
established, MatchLogic will target both MatchLogic and Excite registered users
for the facilitation of the Client's program.  Performance results for these
campaigns will be provided to Client and assist in the development of
strategies for subsequent e-mail campaigns.Projected delivery schedules for DeliverE(sm) services over the [*****]-year
term of this agreement are as follows.

SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT  
This Sponsorship Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into effective January 1, 2010 by and between Stallings Capital Group Consultants, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership dba Bob Stallings Racing (“Racing”), and GAINSCO, INC., a Texas corporation (the “Sponsor”).  
Racing organized and operated a racing team engaging in Daytona Prototype Series auto racing (the “Racing Team”) in professional races in 2005 through 2008, and the Sponsor was the primary sponsor of the Racing Team pursuant to Sponsorship Agreements dated February 7, 2005, February 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2009. Racing has invited the Sponsor to continue to act as the primary sponsor of the Racing Team for 2010, and the Sponsor desires to act in that capacity. In consideration of the sponsorship fee provided for herein, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement to govern the terms of such sponsorship in 2010.  
Now, therefore, Racing and the Sponsor hereby agree as follows:  
1. Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, the term of this Agreement and the sponsorship described herein shall commence on January 1, 2010 and extend through December 31, 2010.  
2. Advertising and Other Benefits. Subject to payment by the Sponsor of the sponsorship fee provided for herein, during the term of this Agreement Racing shall cause the Racing Team to provide for the Sponsor’s benefit all of the benefits customarily associated with the sponsorship of a Daytona Prototype Series racing team and consistent with the benefits provided to the Sponsor in 2005 - 2009 (individually, a “Benefit,” and collectively, the “Benefits”), including but not limited to the following:  
(i) displaying prominent identification of the Sponsor’s name and/or logo in signage on the race car and racing suits and, where appropriate, on other team equipment (subject to approval by the Sponsor);  
(ii) making available for the use of the Sponsor (x) the personalities associated with the Racing Team, including without limitation the name, voice, picture, portrait, likeness, persona and/or signature of each driver for endorsements, commercial advertising and promotions in any and all media throughout the world during the term of this Agreement, (y) the Racing Team’s home base facilities in Texas, and (z) those facilities designated or assigned for the use of the Racing Team at each race and race location at which the Racing Team actually participates in the race, all for appropriate public relations and other promotional and marketing purposes. Racing agrees that it will actively participate in the Rolex 24 at Daytona in January, 2010. As it concerns (y) and (z) above, access shall be subject to appropriate security and safety restrictions designated by the applicable racing location and the Racing Team;(iii) making available for the use of the Sponsor a non-racing look-alike (a “Show Car”) of the GAINSCO 99 race car (the “Car”) used by the Racing Team. Subject to the Sponsor’s first right to use the Show Car, it will also be made available to Racing when such use does not interfere with the Sponsor’s use of the Show Car;  
(iv) allowing the Sponsor the use of the likeness of the Car, including all paint and graphics, for promotion and advertising of or by the Sponsor, and Racing shall be responsible for all necessary consents and permissions from any other sponsors to be sure the Sponsor can use the likeness of the Car as specified herein;  
(v) prohibiting the endorsement by Racing and any members of Racing, including the drivers, of any entities, products or services which are in direct competition or otherwise inconsistent with the Sponsor or it products or services, unless such endorsement activity is approved in writing by Racing and the Sponsor; and  
(vi) allowing the Sponsor to use the conference room and other areas of the racing shop and garage for meetings and similar events, provided that the Sponsor gives prior notice of the need for such use, and such use does not interfere with operations of the racing shop and garage and is otherwise consistent with reasonable requirements imposed by Racing to assure orderly operations and provide for adequate safety measures at all times.  
3. Sponsorship Fee. The Sponsor shall pay to Racing a sponsorship fee in the amount of $750,000.00 for the term of this Agreement, payable in an initial installment payable on or before February 1, 2010 in the amount of $350,000.00 and ten installments of $40,000.00 on or before the first day of each month commencing March 1, 2010 and ending with the installment due on December 1, 2010 (unless this Agreement is sooner terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof, in which case Sponsor shall have no obligation to make any payments after the date of termination).  
4. Compliance with Applicable Rules and Regulations. Provision of the Benefits pursuant to this Agreement is subject to rules and requirements of each organization and venue hosting a racing event in which the Racing Team competes during the term hereof, and the Sponsor agrees to submit to Racing all advertising and other promotional material relating to each such event in sufficient time to enable Racing to assure compliance with such rules and requirements. If as a result of such rules and requirements Racing is unable to provide a Benefit in the form requested by the Sponsor, Racing shall be permitted to provide a substitute promotion or advertisement in compliance with such requirements.  
  25. Sponsor’s Maximum Obligation; Indemnification. Racing represents to the Sponsor that the Sponsor’s aggregate obligation hereunder will not exceed the amount of the sponsorship fee set forth in Section 3 hereof (or such lesser amount as is payable by the Sponsor in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof), plus, if applicable, collection costs that may be reasonably incurred by Racing in a legal proceeding to collect all or any part thereof (the “Maximum Obligation”). Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors, agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.  
6. Retention of Rights. The only rights granted to the Sponsor hereunder are the right to receive the Benefits, and Racing hereby retains all other rights with respect to the Racing Team, including but not limited to logos, symbols, names and other marks and intellectual property of the Racing Team, and any proceeds derived by the Racing Team. The Sponsor hereby retains and does not grant any rights to Racing to use any of its logos, symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property, except for use as described in Section 2 hereof. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or if the sponsorship terminates at the end of the term provided for herein, each of the parties shall retain the rights to use its logos, symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property including, in the case of the Sponsor, the right to use the names and marks “GAINSCO 99”, “the GAINSCO 99 Car”, or similar phrases or derivations thereof.  
7. Relationship to Other Sponsors. The Sponsor acknowledges that Racing has arranged and may arrange in the future for other sponsors for the Racing Team. Racing agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, (i) Sponsor shall have the right to approve or disapprove any additional sponsor identified by Racing, and (ii) unless another proposed sponsor has agreed to pay a sponsorship fee that exceeds the amount paid by Sponsor, no other sponsor shall receive any benefit of greater value (including either an equivalent or a more prominent use of another sponsor’s name, logo or other identifying information) than the Benefits provided to the Sponsor hereunder.  
8. Insurance.  
(a) Racing shall obtain and maintain, at Racing’s expense, comprehensive automobile liability insurance covering all owned, non-owned and hired vehicles used by Racing in the Business with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence combined single limit for personal injury and property damage, including all statutory coverage for all states of operation. Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision insurance on each vehicle used in the Business. Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing “Gainsco Inc. and all related entities” as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.  
(b) Racing shall obtain and maintain pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, at its sole expense, the following types of insurance coverage, with minimum limits as set forth below:  
(i) Commercial General Liability covering liability arising from premises, operations, independent contractors, personal and advertising injury and contractual liability—$5,000,000 each occurrence.  
  3(ii) Racing Owners’ Sponsors (Spectators) Legal Liability including Participant Legal Liability—$5,000,000 each occurrence.  
(iii) Business Automobile Liability covering all owned, hired and non-owned vehicles—$5,000,000 each occurrence, including statutory coverages for all states of operations.  
(iv) Workers Compensation—statutory limits for all states of operation.  
(v) Employers Liability—$5,000,000 each employee for bodily injury by accident and $500,000 each employee for bodily injury by disease.  
All policies of insurance procured by Racing herein shall be written as primary policies, not contributing with or in excess of coverage that the Sponsor may carry. If Racing’s liability policies do not contain the standard separation of insureds provision, or a substantially similar clause, they shall be endorsed to provide cross-liability coverage.  
(c) Racing shall provide the Sponsor with a certificate of insurance evidence compliance with the insurance requirements set forth above. Certificates shall provide that “Gainsco Inc. and all related entities” shall be named as additional insureds on all liability policies, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available to the Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the Sponsor of termination, cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.  
(d) Such certificates shall be in a form acceptable to, and underwritten by insurance company(ies) reasonably satisfactory to the Sponsor. By requiring insurance herein, the Sponsor does not represent that coverage limits will necessarily be adequate to protect Racing.

The Sponsor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on written notice to Racing if any driver, the general manager or any other member of Racing (i) fails to conduct himself/herself in accordance with generally accepted standards of morality, (ii) engages in any activity which reflects adversely on the image, reputation or goodwill of the Sponsor or (iii) disparages the products or services of the Sponsor; provided, however, the Sponsor shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement if Racing, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice by the Sponsor terminates the employment of, or otherwise dismisses from the racing team, the driver(s), general manager(s) or other member(s) of Racing engaging in the offensive conduct. Upon termination, the Sponsor shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of monies paid for services not yet performed by Racing based upon the number of races for the applicable racing season. The Sponsor’s decision with respect to all matters arising under this Section shall be conclusive.  
  410. Remedies. If either party breaches any provision of this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to seek monetary damages and, if appropriate, equitable relief to require the performance of the obligations hereunder.  
11. Assignment. Neither party shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.  
12. Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver; Confidentiality. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Racing and the Sponsor with respect to the subject matter hereof and supercedes all prior agreements and understandings. Any amendment of this Agreement must be by a written instrument signed by both parties, and any waiver of any provision hereof must be in writing, signed by the party agreeing to such waiver. Each of the parties hereto agrees to hold in confidence the terms hereof and, unless otherwise required by law, neither party shall release, disclose or publish any of the terms hereof without the prior written consent of the other party.  
13. Notices. All notices and communications to be made with respect to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be effective only when delivered by (i) hand, (ii) prepaid certified United States mail, return receipt requested, or (iii) overnight delivery service providing proof of delivery, addressed as follows:
