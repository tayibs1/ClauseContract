Management", governed under III. and IV. in these General Terms and
Conditions) for integration of the Affiliate Program provided by element 5.
I. Object of the Affiliate Program/ Affiliate Management Program for
Software Publishers

dependent Advertising Cost Compensation (also known in the element 5

advertisements. The Advertising Cost Compensation depends on the actual
sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the
Affiliate's link).
Within the context of sales processed from this Program, element 5 acts (to
the end user) as a service provider for Software Publisher and handles the
sales process by proxy of Software Publisher in accordance with underlying

from the participating Publishers for this Affiliate Management.

Panel" shall mean the password protected secure interface on element 5's
Web servers that allows the Software Publisher to gain access to Sales data
and End User data through a secure online connection and change Software
Publisher related settings, e.g. the commission of the Affiliate and
activation and deactivation of the Affiliate.
"Affiliate's Control Panel" shall mean the password protected secure
interface on element 5's Web servers that allows the Affiliate to (i) gain
access to referred sales through a secure online connection and (ii) change
Affiliate related settings, e.g. input or alteration of personal data,
definition of default style within the context of the given technical
limitations, and requests for new partnerships with Software Publishers or
termination of existing partnerships.

§ 1 Affiliate Participation
Participation of an individual Affiliate in the Program is dependent on
activation by the Software Publisher. Once the Affiliate has registered,
element 5 will send an e-mail to Software Publisher with a request to
activate the Affiliate. Once the Affiliate is activated by the Software
Publisher, the Affiliate is considered to be a participant in this program
and is bound by these General Terms and Conditions.
§ 2 Products under the Agreement
(1) The Products under the Agreement are software products designated by
the respective Software Publisher for this purpose and which can be
selected by the Affiliate from a product catalog in the Affiliate Control
Panel.
(2) Following initial activation of a product under the agreement, the
Affiliate has the opportunity to choose further software products
(including those from other Software Publishers), found in the Affiliate's
Control Panel, and offer them on the Affiliate's Web site under these
General Terms and Conditions. However, the offering of these new products
is dependent on the Software Publisher activating the Affiliate for the
respective software.
§ 3 Control Panel
(1) After successfully completing the registration process for
participation in the Program, the Affiliate will be sent a user ID and a
password to access to the "Affiliate Control Panel". With the user ID and

password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has
learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall immediately report
this to element 5, which can then block access by the Affiliate to the
Control Panel. All actions carried out with the user ID and password will
be attributed to the Affiliate.

appropriate link on its Web site; the link points to the order form
operated by element 5. This link is generated by a Link Generator for the
respective product under the agreement. The Link
Source: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005Generator is located in the secure area of element 5's Web site in the
"Affiliate Control Panel". The link that is generated contains an
individualized affiliate user ID by means of which any sales can be
attributed to the Affiliate. Proper technical integration of the link is
the responsibility of the Affiliate. If the links do not function, no
Advertising Cost Compensation will be paid.
(2) The Affiliate shall indicate on its Web site that (i) the Affiliate is

participation in the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 and (ii) The
Software Publisher is the seller of the product and the payment process is

product on its Web site. The Affiliate is responsible for the content, the
style and the layout of this information. The Software Publisher can
provide the Affiliate with graphics and text in an electronic format for
use in describing the product, which the Affiliate shall use for the
purpose of advertising the Products under the Agreement and links according
to the instructions of the Software Publisher. The Affiliate should be
aware that the product prices and availability may change at any time. It

Developer Agreement; and provide end user service relating to the
administration of the order. The Software Publisher shall provide technical
end-user service.

meet its requirements; including, in particular, orders by referred end
users who do not meet credit requirements, who do not authorize direct
debiting from their bank account, or who do not present a valid credit
card.
(3) An agreement by the Software Publisher with the referred end user does
not exist until either a written or electronic order confirmation arrives
from element 5 in the name of the Software Publisher or when element 5
begins to fulfill the agreement in the name of the Software Publisher.
Typographical, printing and computation errors on the Web site of the
Affiliate shall be charged to said Affiliate.
§ 6 Advertising Cost Compensation
(1) element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs (including Vat, if
any, on presentation of a valid VAT invoice) if an end user arrives via the
link integrated in Affiliate's Web site at the order page hosted by element
5 for the respective Software
Source: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005Publisher's Product under this Agreement and end user uses the automatic
ordering system that carries out the registration and payment processing,
so that the Affiliate's link is deemed to be directly causative for the
entry of the End User into the agreement with the Software Publisher and
End User's payment, proving that all requirements are irrevocably met
("agreements arising in a qualified manner"). Affiliate is only eligible to
earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term
of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain
payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned.

Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do
arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or
possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher
via integrated link.
(3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of
said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate.
(4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost
Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes,
shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user.
The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be
stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the
effective gross sales price of the software.
(5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as
it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or
will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to
the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit
card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software
product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid
by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own
discretion.
(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly
insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not
the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100
EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the
Affiliate's participation in the Program.
(7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or
check, as chosen by the Affiliate.
(8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object
in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.

                               AFFILIATE AGREEMENT
         This Agreement entered into as of the Effective Date by and between
Link Plus Corporation  and Axiometric, LLC.
                                    RECITALS
         WHEREAS, Axiometric has developed certain computer software including
wireless mesh networking technology and AMR devices and systems;
         WHEREAS, LKPL has developed certain radio devices and systems along
with hardware manufacturing capacities and plans to develop AMR devices and
systems;
         WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric believe it will be in their mutual best
interests to cooperate in further developing AMR product suites by creating a
preferred provider relationship between themselves;
         WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric entered into a Letter of Intent dated May
3, 2005, and now desire to further describe their relationship as initially set
forth in the non-binding portions of that Letter of Intent.
         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained
herein, the fees to be paid in connection therewith, and other good and valuable
consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
1.       DEFINITIONS
         1.1      Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise
                  requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not
                  capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified. If other
                  terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then
                  throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings
                  respectively ascribed to them.
2.       OFFICE SPACE
         2.1      During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide
                  Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's
                  corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge.
         2.2      LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two
                  individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient
                  for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and
                  not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have
                  access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections,
                  conference room, and printers.
         2.3      If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own
                  purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without
                  having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with
                  comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to
                  provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's
                  facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best
                  interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford
                  Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new
                  facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial
                  rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent
                  office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's
                  license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days
                  notice.

                  equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property
                  that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business.
                  LKPL will have no obligation to provide any special facilities
                  or infrastructure unless otherwise negotiated.
         2.5      LKPL will have no liability whatsoever for any of Axiometric's
                  equipment, furniture, supplies or other personal property;
                  Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk.
         2.6      Axiometric will have the right to terminate the license to use
                  the office space and to move out of the office space at any
                  time upon two weeks notice.
         2.7      Axiometric must at all times use the office space strictly in
                  accordance with terms and conditions stated in LKPL's lease
                  for the space.
         2.8      Axiometric must indemnify and hold LKPL and its officers,
                  directors, stockholders, agents, contractors, employees and
                  guests (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless from
                  and against any and all Loss that the Indemnified Parties may
                  incur arising from or relating to Axiometric use of the office
                  space, including but not limited to any Loss suffered by the
                  Indemnified Parties as a result of any negligent acts or
                  omissions of Axiometric, its employees, agents, contractors
                  and representatives, or anyone else working under Axiometric
                  or in the office with the permission of Axiometric.
3.       AUTOMATIC METER READING
         Axiometric and LKPL agree to jointly pursue accessing and commercially
         penetrating the AMR market by developing a suite of qualified and
         commercially marketable product suites for that market, marketing and
         selling that suite of products. The following shall be the general
         roles and responsibilities of the two companies with respect to AMR
         efforts:
         3.1      AMR Products
                  3.1.1    Water Meter Development: Axiometric and LKPL are
                           jointly developing an AMR product for remote reading
                           of residential water utility meters (hereafter the
                           Water Meter). The Water Meter is a hardware device
                           with integral software. The software includes, under
                           license, the Axiometric wireless mesh networking
                           intellectual property. The Water Meter is capable of
                           interfacing with a variety of water meter registers,
                           recording water usage, logging various exceptional
                           conditions, and reporting them via a radio link. The
                           Water Meter is also capable of forming a mesh network
                           with other Water Meters to extend the radio reporting
                           range using the aforementioned Axiometric mesh
                           networking intellectual property. The Water Meter
                           software and hardware are based on existing
                           Axiometric electric meter AMR hardware and software
                           products; joint ownership of the Water Meter does not
                           convey joint ownership of those existing products or
                           of the mesh networking intellectual property.
                           New software and hardware designs and intellectual
                           property developed in the course of the Water Meter
                           development are jointly owned; specifically, the
                           algorithms used to collect data directly from a Water
                           Meter using a point-to-point link (drive-by data
                           collection), the specific hardware designs related to
                           water register interface, battery power management,
                           and other intellectual property specifically
Source: LINK PLUS CORP, 8-K, 8/2/2005described and mutually agreed in writing as
                           amendments to this Agreement. Joint ownership conveys
                           to each party individually the right to use, sell,
                           modify, and create derived works from said
                           intellectual property, as well as the right to
                           sub-license these rights to others.
                  3.1.2    Energy AMR Product Suite: Axiometric has developed an
                           AMR product suite for use in energy (electric)
                           metering consisting of a meter insert for interfacing
                           to energy meters, recording usage and exceptional
                           conditions, and transmitting the information via
                           radio to a central collector. Axiometric has also
                           developed mesh networking intellectual property to
                           allow the meter inserts to relay information from
                           insert to insert thus extending the range and
                           reliability of such information transmissions.
                           Axiometric has also developed a central collection
                           unit (hereafter Mesh Controller or Gateway) capable
                           of collecting usage and other information from a
                           large number of meter inserts and relaying that
                           information onto another communications medium
                           (radio, GSM, etc.) for delivery to a processing
                           system. Axiometric has also developed processing
                           software for recording the collected data to a
                           database, presenting
                           and managing that information, and exporting the data
                           to other processing systems.  This collection of
                           products forms an energy metering (electric) AMR
                           Product Suite that is owned by Axiometric.
                  3.1.3    Axiometric and LKPL may develop other AMR Product
                           Suites (e.g. for gas metering) and ownership of those
                           AMR Product Suites will be held individually by the
                           developer of the suite or jointly if mutually agreed
                           to in writing.
         3.2      Marketing and Sales: Regardless of ownership and in order to
                  coordinate marketing and prevent overlap and confusion by
                  customers and potential customers, all sales and marketing
                  shall be conducted as follows:
                  3.2.1    Axiometric shall have the exclusive right to market
                           and sell AMR Product Suites to entities whose
                           corporate headquarters are physically located in the
                           United States and U.S. territories with the exception
                           of Datamatic as defined in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 below
                  3.2.2    LKPL shall have the exclusive right to market and
                           sell AMR Product Suites to Datamatic LTD, a Plano TX
                           corporation (hereafter Datamatic).
                  3.2.3    LKPL shall have the exclusive right to market and
                           sell AMR Product Suites to entities whose corporate
                           headquarters are physically located outside the
                           United States and its territories.
                  3.2.4    The proceeds of all sales shall be distributed
                           pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as set forth
                           in Section 3.3  [Proceeds] below.
         3.3      Proceeds: As a result of the different ownership interests,
                  marketing relationships, and this Agreement, the proceeds of
                  sales of AMR Product Suites shall be as follows unless

                                    audit is conducted, then the quarterly
                                    reports for that year will be deemed
                                    accurate.
                           c.       In the event a Payee's audit shows that the
                                    Gross Proceeds or Production Costs of the

                                    confirms the report of the Payee's auditor,
                                    then the Payor will pay the deficiency
                                    within fifteen (15) days from the time Payee
                                    invoices for the deficiency.
                           d.       In the event a Payee's audit shows that the
                                    Gross Proceeds or Production Costs of the
                                    Payor resulted in an under-payment of more
                                    than three percent (3.0%) to the Payee, then
                                    the Payor shall have the right, at the
                                    Payor's cost, to have its own auditor verify
                                    the audit. If the Payor audit confirms the
                                    report of the Payee's auditor, then the
                                    Payor will pay the deficiency and the cost
                                    of the Payee's audit within fifteen (15)
                                    days from the time Payee invoices for those
                                    fees and provides standard proof of the time
                                    and expenses incurred.

3.GRANT OF RIGHTS; ACQUIRED STATIONS:
 
(a) Network hereby grants to Affiliate the exclusive right via Broadcast  Television, and Affiliate hereby accepts such exclusive
right and the obligation during  the Term to broadcast the Service via Broadcast Television (i) over the transmission  facilities of each Station
identified on Exhibit A, which is licensed by the FCC to serve the community for each such Station (the  “Licensed Community”), for receipt by TV
Households in the DMA in which the Licensed Community is located,  as such DMA is identified on Exhibit A, and (ii) over the transmission
facilities of any Acquired Station, except to the extent that, as of the date Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its binding agreement to acquire
such Acquired Station, (A) another Broadcast Television  station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to  broadcast the
Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast  other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service. Affiliate shall telecast
the Service from each Station’s origination transmitter and antenna for  free over-the-air television reception, and by other customary means used  by
each Station to transmit its signal in its DMA (e.g., FCC-licensed translators and fiber or microwave connections to MVPDs).  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Affiliate shall have the right to authorize, and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain, carriage of the Service’s signal by  MVPDs that
retransmit digital Broadcast Television signals in the DMA of each Station that transmits the Service, which Service signal shall be transmitted  by
Affiliate together with the Primary Feed. Affiliate’s failure to obtain such carriage by any MVPD shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.
Affiliate shall endeavor to secure carriage of the Service by MVPDs on the most highly  penetrated level of digital service. Further, Affiliate shall
have the right to authorize carriage of the Service’s signal on a nonexclusive basis by MVPDs that  retransmit a Station’s Primary Feed outside the
Station’s DMA, and that are carrying the Station’s analog signal as of the date of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding
sentence, (1) Affiliate shall not authorize an MVPD to deliver the Service to subscribers outside the  Station’s DMA in areas in which the Station,
pursuant to FCC rules, is not “significantly viewed,” if the MVPD receives the Station’s signal via satellite,  and (2) any agreement by Affiliate for
out-of-DMA carriage of the Service shall require that the MVPD’s authorization from Affiliate to carry the Service terminate upon the initial over-
the-air transmission of the Service by a  Broadcast Television station whose Licensed Community is located within the  DMA of the pertinent MVPD
system if such station has exclusive rights to broadcast  the Service in such DMA. Network shall provide Affiliate with at least 45 days’ advance
written notice of such Broadcast Television’s station’s initial  over-the-air transmission of the Service and Affiliate shall provide such  notice to the
pertinent MVPD. In the event Affiliate owns more than one Station  in any DMA (a “Duopoly Market”), then Affiliate, at its option, shall have the
right to determine which of its Stations in such DMA shall broadcast the Service; it being understood that  Affiliate shall have no obligation to
broadcast the Service over more than  one of its Stations in any particular DMA.

the preceding paragraph concerning  Duopoly Markets) continue to transmit the Service and become a “Station” hereunder. Any existing agreement
between or among Network and any one or more third parties applicable to such Station for the transmission of the Service  shall terminate and
cease to be effective upon its acquisition by Affiliate.  Any Acquired Station in a DMA that is not transmitting the Service at the time  of acquisition
by Affiliate shall likewise become a “Station” hereunder upon  acquisition and shall commence transmitting the Service within one hundred  eighty
(180) days after the acquisition is consummated, unless, as provided  in 3(a) above, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as
the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the  Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that
precludes it from also carrying the Service. If condition (A) or (B) applies, the Acquired Station  shall have no obligations hereunder, and Network
shall have the right to license  the transmission of the Service to another Broadcast Television station in  such DMA, including on an exclusive
basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if  condition (A) applies, unless the existing affiliate is a Charter Affiliate, Network shall give Affiliate at least
six (6) months’ prior written notice of the impending expiration of an existing affiliate’s affiliation agreement and, upon such notice, Affiliate shall
have the option to add the pertinent Acquired  Station as a “Station” hereunder as of the date of expiration of the existing  affiliate’s affiliation
agreement, provided that Affiliate exercises such right  in writing at least four (4) months prior to the expiration of the existing affiliate’s affiliation
agreement.
 
(c) Except as expressly provided in Section 3(a), Affiliate shall not have the right (i) to subdistribute or otherwise sublicense the

delayed, “video-on-demand” or similar basis. For purposes hereof, “ video-on-demand” means the transmission of a television signal by means of a
point-to-point distribution system containing audiovisual programming chosen by a viewer for  reception on a viewer’s television receiver, where
the scheduling of the  exhibition of the programming is not predetermined by the distributor, but  rather is at the viewer’s discretion.
(d) Except as expressly provided in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) and this Section 3(d), Network  shall not have the right to distribute or
otherwise license the Service for reception in a Station’s DMA, including distributing the Service directly  through an MVPD in a Station’s DMA,
other than through this license to  Affiliate. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Network  shall not distribute or authorize third
parties to distribute the Service to  subscribers by any technology (other than Broadcast Television and transmission  by an MVPD), on an
interactive, time-delayed (other than multiple time-zone feeds of the Service), “video-on-demand” or similar basis, as an audio-only  service (e.g.,
radio) or over the Internet. For purposes of clarification, a promotional or marketing  “stunt” simulcasting a live or special event, or brief excerpts of
the Service made available on a non-subscription basis for promotional purposes shall not  be prohibited by this Section 3(d) or any other provision
herein.

end of a calendar quarter, Network shall supply such  statement as of the date of termination, within forty-five (45) days thereafter,  and this
obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement until  Affiliate receives such statement.

once in any calendar year, Affiliate shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense,  during the Term and for one (1) year
thereafter, to examine during normal business hours the books and records of Network for up to the prior calendar  year and the
then-current calendar year solely to the extent reasonably  necessary to verify the Revenue Share Records.
 
(ii) Any audit conducted pursuant to this Section 7(d) shall be conducted by Affiliate’s  corporate audit staff or an independent

right, whether known or unknown, to collect any shortfalls from Network for the period(s)  audited; provided, however, that such
limitation shall not apply to intentional misconduct by Network or its agents or employees.

Promotional Spots and other promotional  materials, which, if using any programming from the Service, must be approved in advance by Network,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Network  and Affiliate agree to consult on a regular basis during the Term concerning the  content
of the Promotional Spots, promotional materials and on Network and  Affiliate promotional strategies, and Affiliate shall cease airing particular

the same approximate time each hour of the broadcast day. Affiliate shall have the right to retain for itself all the proceeds derived from the  sale of
Local Advertising. Affiliate agrees not to sell commercial time to or for the benefit of direct competitors of the Service (e.g., music video networks
carried by MVPDs such as MTV, VH1 and Fuse). All Local Advertising shall comply with the pertinent Station’s generally applicable  broadcast
standards and Affiliate shall be solely responsible for all Local  Advertising and all liabilities associated therewith, including insertion,  trafficking,
billing and collection activities relating to the Local Advertising  and for the content of the material inserted into the Local Advertising.
 
(d) Network, from time to time, may undertake marketing tests and surveys, rating polls  and other research in connection with the
Service. With respect to any tests,  surveys or research that apply to any Station or DMA for which Network seeks  Affiliate’s cooperation, Network
shall notify Affiliate of the nature and scope  of each such project and Affiliate, to the extent permitted by applicable law  and agreements by which
Affiliate or a Station is bound, shall cooperate in  such research by rendering such assistance as Network may reasonably request and  which
Affiliate can reasonably provide without incurring any additional expense.  Network shall, promptly following receipt, provide the full results of any
such research to Affiliate, on a confidential basis, unless Network is prevented  from doing so by a confidentiality agreement or applicable law.

any other provision of this Agreement. The  failure of Affiliate or Network to enforce or seek enforcement of the terms of this Agreement following
any breach shall not be construed as a waiver of a  subsequent breach of the same or any other terms of this Agreement. All  remedies, whether at
law, in equity or pursuant to this Agreement shall be  cumulative.

facilities or the non-furnishing of the Service if such  non-operation or non-furnishing is due to an act of God; inevitable accident; fire; weather;
lockout; strike or other labor dispute; riot or civil commotion; action or  inaction of government or governmental instrumentality (whether federal,

then Affiliate shall have ninety (90) calendar days from Affiliate’s receipt of Network’s comprehensive business plan for such New Channels to
determine whether Affiliate desires to enter into an agreement with respect to the New Channels.  At the expiration of the ninety (90)-day period,
Affiliate’s right of first refusal shall expire. If, during said ninety (90)-day period, Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its desire to add the New
Channels to this Agreement,  then both parties shall work diligently together and in good faith to enter into  an agreement within ninety (90) days of
such notice to include the terms and  conditions pursuant to which the New Channels may be distributed by Affiliate.  If, having used good faith
diligent efforts, Affiliate and Network have failed to enter into such an agreement within such ninety (90)-day period, then neither  party shall have
an obligation to continue such negotiations or enter into  an agreement with respect to the New Channels.

their audiences, the identity of any person or entity  that has given anything of value to Network or anyone associated with the  Service in exchange
for the inclusion of a product, service, trademark, brand  name, or other program material in the Service. Network agrees to disclose to Affiliate, in
writing, the existence, source and nature of any payments or  other consideration received in connection with the production of the Service. Such
disclosure shall be made prior to the time such matter is broadcast, so that  each Station can satisfy its disclosure obligations under federal law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, proper disclosure in the  content of the Service will satisfy Network’s disclosure obligations to

REVENUE SHARE 
 
Commencing on the Affiliate Launch Date and thereafter throughout the Term, Network shall  pay to Affiliate the following amounts:
I.Affiliate Advertising Share.
 
1.Determining Affiliate Advertising Share. Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each calendar
quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Advertising Share. For purposes hereof, the
“Affiliate Advertising Share” shall be determined by multiplying fifteen percent (15%) of Network’s Advertising Revenue for
such calendar quarter by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the total number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households  in the
DMA(s) of the Station(s) transmitting the Service pursuant to this  Agreement, and the denominator of which is the total number
of Digital Cable Subscriber Households in all of the DMAs in which Network has  a broadcast television station affiliate that is
transmitting the Service. If a Station commences transmitting the Service on other than the first  day of a calendar quarter, then the
Affiliate Advertising Share for such quarter shall be further prorated based on the number of days in  such quarter that such
Station transmitted the Service. For purposes of  this Exhibit D, The number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households shall be
determined by the certified report supplied by each MVPD distributing the service,  described in Section 7(a) of the body of this
Agreement. In the event that such report is not received by Network with respect to each and every  MVPD that carries the
Service, then, for purposes of this  Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households shall be determined  as follows:
  
a.In the event that the total number of linear digital video subscribers  served by an MVPD that distributes the Service is
not broken out by DMAs  in such MVPD’s reported data, then, for purposes of this  Exhibit D, the number of Digital
Cable Subscriber Households for such non-reporting  MVPD shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of TV
Households  receiving linear video services from such MVPD’s systems that carry the  Service in the pertinent DMA as
set forth in a Nielsen report such  as FOCUS multiplied by (y) the National Digital Cable Penetration Percentage most
recently reported by such MVPD. The “ National Digital Cable Penetration Percentage” shall be equal to the quotient of
(i) the total number of subscribers  to linear digital video services as most recently publicly reported  by such MVPD,
divided by (ii) the total number of TV Households receiving  linear video services from such MVPD as most recently
publicly reported by such MVPD.

Source: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006b. In the event that a particular MVPD does not report its total number  of subscribers to linear digital video services and
total number of TV Households receiving linear video services, then, for purposes of  this Exhibit D, the number of
Digital Cable Subscriber Households for such non-reporting  MVPD shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of TV
Households  receiving linear video services served by such MVPD’s systems that carry  the Service as set forth in a
Nielsen report such as FOCUS multiplied by (y) a national digital cable penetration estimate from Kagan Research,  LLC.
 
 c. In the event that a more accurate independent publicly available  source for determining the number of television
households that receive  the Service through a subscription cable service hereafter becomes available,  the parties may
mutually agree to use such source in lieu of the  foregoing.
 
2.Payment. The Affiliate Advertising Share, if any, shall be payable quarterly and shall be due no later than forty-five (45) days
following the end of each calendar quarter for which a payment is due. If this Agreement is terminated during a calendar quarter,
the amount payable shall be determined as of the termination date.
  
II.Affiliate Transactional Share.
 
1.Determining Affiliate Transactional Share. Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each
calendar quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Transactional Share. For purposes hereof,
the “Affiliate Transactional Share” means fifteen percent (15%) of Network’s Transactional Revenue for the pertinent calendar
quarter.
 
2.Payment. The Affiliate Transactional Share, if any, shall be payable quarterly and shall be due no later than forty-five (45) days
following the end of each calendar quarter for which a payment is due. If this Agreement is terminated during a calendar quarter,

                              AFFILIATE AGREEMENT
                              -------------------
                                        
Physician Sales & Service, Inc.
4345 Southpoint Boulevard
Jacksonville, Florida  32216
Attention:  Patrick C. Kelly
            David A. Smith
Gentlemen:
     The undersigned is a shareholder of Gulf South Medical Supply, Inc.
("GSMS"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and will become a shareholder of Physician Sales & Service, Inc.
("PSS"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Florida, pursuant to the transactions described in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December 14, 1997 (the "Agreement"), by and among PSS, PSS
Merger Corp. ("Merger Corp.") and GSMS.  Under the terms of the Agreement,
Merger Corp. will be merged into and with GSMS (the "Merger"), and the shares of
the $.01 par value common stock of GSMS ("GSMS Common Stock") will be converted
into and exchanged for shares of the $.01 par value common stock of PSS ("PSS
Common Stock").  This Affiliate Agreement represents an agreement between the
undersigned and PSS regarding certain rights and obligations of the undersigned
in connection with the shares of PSS to be received by the undersigned as a
result of the Merger.
     In consideration of the Merger and the mutual covenants contained herein,
the undersigned and PSS hereby agree as follows:
     1.  Affiliate Status.  The undersigned understands and agrees that as to
         ----------------                                                    
GSMS he is an "affiliate" under Rule 145(c) as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules
and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act"), and the undersigned anticipates
that he will be such an "affiliate" at the time of the Merger.
     2.  Initial Restriction on Disposition.  The undersigned agrees that he
         ----------------------------------                                 
will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his interests in, or reduce his
risk relative to, any of the shares of PSS Common Stock into which his shares of
GSMS Common Stock are converted upon consummation of the Merger until such time
as PSS notifies the undersigned that the requirements of SEC Accounting Series
Release Nos. 130 and 135 ("ASR 130 and 135") have been met. The undersigned
understands that ASR 130 and 135 relate to publication of financial results of
post-Merger combined operations of PSS and GSMS. PSS agrees that it will publish
such results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the sole
discretion of PSS, but in any event within 45 days after the end of the first
fiscal quarter of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combined
operations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following such
publication.
     3.  Covenants and Warranties of Undersigned.  The undersigned represents,
         ---------------------------------------                              
warrants and agrees that:
     (a) The PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned as a result of the
   Merger will be taken for his own account and not for others, directly or
   indirectly, in whole or in part.
     (b) PSS has informed the undersigned that any distribution by the
   undersigned of PSS Common Stock has not been registered under the 1933 Act
   and that shares of PSS Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger can only
   be sold by the undersigned (1) following registration under the 1933 Act, or
   (2) in conformity with the volume and other requirements of Rule 145(d)
   promulgated by the SEC as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, or
   (3) to the extent some other exemption from registration under the 1933 Act
   might be available.  The undersigned understands that PSS is under no
                        ------------------------------------------------
   obligation to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   disposition of the undersigned's shares of PSS Common
   -----------------------------------------------------  
 
   Stock or to take any other action necessary to make compliance with an
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   exemption from such registration available.
   ------------------------------------------
     (c) During the 30 days immediately preceding the Effective Time of the
   Merger, the undersigned has not sold, transfered, or otherwise disposed of
   his interests in, or reduced his risk relative to, any of the shares of GSMS
   Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned as of the record date for
   determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting
   of GSMS held to approve the Merger.
     (d) The undersigned is aware that PSS intends to treat the Merger as a tax-
   free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code")for federal income tax purposes.  The undersigned agrees to treat the
   transaction in the same manner as PSS for federal income tax purposes.  The
   undersigned acknowledges that Section 1.368-1(b) of the Income Tax
   Regulations requires "continuity of interest" in order for the Merger to be
   treated as tax-free under Section 368 of the Code. This requirement is
   satisfied if, taking into account those GSMS shareholders who receive cash in
   exchange for their stock, who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, or
   who dissent from the Merger, there is no plan or intention on the part of the
   GSMS shareholders to sell or otherwise dispose of the PSS Common Stock to be
   received in the Merger that will reduce such shareholders' ownership to a
   number of shares having, in the aggregate, a value at the time of the Merger
   of less than 50% of the total fair market value of the GSMS Common Stock
   outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The undersigned has no
   prearrangement, plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an amount
   of his PSS Common Stock to be received in the Merger which would cause the
   foregoing requirement not to be satisfied.
     4.  Restrictions on Transfer.  The undersigned understands and agrees that
         ------------------------                                              
stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares of PSS Common Stock
received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be given to PSS's
transfer agent and that there will be placed on the certificates for such
shares, or shares issued in substitution thereof, a legend stating in substance:
   "The shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a
   business combination which is accounted for as a "pooling of interests" and
   may not be sold, nor may the owner thereof reduce his risks relative thereto
   in any way, until such time as PSS, Inc. ("PSS") has published the financial
   results covering at least 30 days of combined operations after the effective
   date of the merger through which the business combination was effected.  In
   addition, the shares represented by this certificate may not be sold,
   transferred or otherwise disposed of except or unless (1) covered by an
   effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
   amended, (2) in accordance with (i) Rule 145(d) (in the case of shares issued
   to an individual who is not an affiliate of PSS) or (ii) Rule 144 (in the
                           ---                                              
   case of shares issued to an individual who is an affiliate of PSS) of the
   Rules and Regulations of such Act, or (3) in accordance with a legal opinion
   satisfactory to counsel for PSS that such sale or transfer is otherwise
   exempt from the registration requirements of such Act."
Such legend will also be placed on any certificate representing PSS securities
issued subsequent to the original issuance of the PSS Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger as a result of any transfer of such shares or any stock dividend,
stock split, or other recapitalization as long as the PSS Common Stock issued to
the undersigned pursuant to the Merger has not been transferred in such manner
to justify the removal of the legend therefrom.  Upon the request of the
undersigned, PSS shall cause the certificates representing the shares of PSS
Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be
reissued free of any legend relating to restrictions on transfer by virtue of
ASR 130 and 135 as soon as practicable after the requirements of ASR 130 and 135
have been met.  In addition, if the provisions of Rules 144 and 145 are amended
to eliminate restrictions applicable to the PSS Common Stock received by the
undersigned pursuant to the Merger, or at the expiration of the restrictive
period set forth in Rule 145(d), PSS, upon the request of the undersigned, will
cause the certificates representing the shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the
undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any legend
relating to the restrictions set forth in Rules 144 and 145(d) upon receipt by
PSS of an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such legend may be removed.
                                     - 2 -
 
     5.  Understanding of Restrictions on Dispositions.  The undersigned has
         ---------------------------------------------                      
carefully read the Agreement and this Affiliate Agreement and discussed their
requirements and impact upon his ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose
of the shares of PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned, to the extent he
believes necessary, with his counsel or counsel for GSMS.
     6.  Filing of Reports by PSS.  PSS agrees, for a period of three years
         ------------------------                                          
after the effective date of the Merger, to file on a timely basis all reports
required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, so that the public information provisions of Rule 145(d)
promulgated by the SEC as the same are presently in effect will be available to
the undersigned in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any shares of
PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger.
     7.  Transfer Under Rule 145(d).  If the undersigned desires to sell or
         --------------------------                                        
otherwise transfer the shares of PSS Common Stock received by him in connection
with the Merger at any time during the restrictive period set forth in Rule
145(d), the undersigned will provide the necessary representation letter to the
transfer agent for PSS Common Stock together with such additional information as
the transfer agent may reasonably request.  If PSS's counsel concludes that such
proposed sale or transfer complies with the requirements of Rule 145(d), PSS
shall cause such counsel to provide such opinions as may be necessary to PSS's
Transfer Agent so that the undersigned may complete the proposed sale or
transfer.
     8.  Acknowledgments.  The undersigned recognizes and agrees that the
         ---------------                                                 
foregoing provisions also apply to all shares of the capital stock of GSMS and
PSS that are deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to
applicable federal securities laws, which the undersigned agrees may include,without limitation, shares owned or held in the name of (i) the undersigned's
spouse, (ii) any relative of the undersigned or of the undersigned's spouse who
has the same home as the undersigned, (iii) any trust or estate in which the
undersigned, the undersigned's spouse, and any such relative collectively own at
least a 10% beneficial interest or of which any of the foregoing serves as
trustee, executor, or in any similar capacity, and (iv) any corporation or other
organization in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse and any such
relative collectively own at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of
the equity interest.  The undersigned further recognizes that, in the event that
the undersigned is a director or officer of PSS or becomes a director or officer
of PSS upon consummation of the Merger, among other things, any sale of PSS
Common Stock by the undersigned within a period of less than six months
following the effective time of the Merger may subject the undersigned to
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.
     9.  Miscellaneous.  This Affiliate Agreement is the complete agreement
         -------------

working  conditions  of  its  Contractors.  All  Local Offices shall bear signs,
emblems  and  other  insignia, including a telephone number, indicating that the

settle Merchant Transactions.  Bank and Network 1 shall, in its sole discretion,
make  the  final  decision  as to whether or not approve or decline any Merchant
