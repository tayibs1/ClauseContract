(a) If and to the extent that Bellicum grants rights with respect to a Bellicum Product under license or other agreement(s) with one or
more Licensees of Bellicum, in no event shall Bellicum grant any rights under Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights other than as expressly
permitted hereunder and as are necessary to use Miltenyi Product for the purpose of the Permitted Use, or any rights that are otherwise
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Quality Agreement.
(b) To the extent that the rights granted to Bellicum hereunder (including Bellicum’s right to use each Miltenyi Product for its Permitted
Use) are shared with one or more of its Subcontractors or Licensees in accordance with the terms hereof, Bellicum shall first impose
limitations and obligations on such Subcontractors or Licensees, in writing, that are consistent with the corresponding limitations and
obligations imposed on Bellicum hereunder, and Bellicum shall notify Miltenyi of the name and contact information for each such
Subcontractor or Licensee that it shares such rights with, in writing, in accordance with Article 16 of this Agreement.
(c) Bellicum shall promptly notify Miltenyi in writing of any additional Licensee contemplating the use of Miltenyi Product(s) for the
manufacture of a Bellicum Product from time to time, which Licensee shall be added to the Bellicum Product specific Module by
amendment.
(d) At the reasonable written request of Bellicum during the Term, Miltenyi shall enter into a direct supply agreement for Miltenyi Products
with any Licensee nominated by Bellicum, materially consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Quality
Agreement (as applicable), except as agreed otherwise in writing between Miltenyi and the respective Bellicum Licensee.
2.10 Liability for Non-Compliance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Bellicum shall, in relation to Miltenyi, at all times and
in all respects continue to remain fully and primarily responsible and liable to Miltenyi for the performance and the acts or omissions of its
Affiliate, Subcontractor, and Licensee in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, including the failure of an Affiliate,
Subcontractor, or Licensee of Bellicum to comply with all of the limitations and obligations imposed on Bellicum hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Miltenyi shall, in relation to Bellicum, at all times and in all respects continue to remain
fully and primarily responsible and liable to Bellicum for the performance and the acts or omissions of its Affiliates and Subcontractors in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, including the failure of an Affiliate or Subcontractor of Miltenyi to comply with all
of the limitations and obligations imposed on Miltenyi hereunder. For clarity, in no event shall any permitted delegation or subcontracting
of any activities to be performed in connection with this Agreement release a Party from any of its limitations or obligations under this
Agreement.
2.11 Governance.
(a) Alliance Managers. Each Party shall appoint an appropriately qualified individual to serve as an alliance manager under this Agreement
(the “Alliance Manager”). Such persons shall endeavor to assure clear and responsive communication between the Parties and the
effective exchange of information, and may serve as the primary point of contact for any matters arising under this Agreement. The
Alliance Managers may attend meetings of the JSC, assist in resolving Disputes at the initial level of the Parties’ good faith discussions,
and may raise issues for discussion by the JSC.

Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
(b) Joint Steering Committee. The Parties hereby establish a joint steering committee (the “JSC”) that will monitor and provide strategic
oversight of the activities under this Agreement, and facilitate communications between the Parties with respect to the supply of Miltenyi
Products and Bellicum’s development and commercialization of Bellicum Products. Each Party shall initially appoint up to three (3)
representatives (or their designees) to the JSC, excluding the Alliance Manager of each Party who will attend JSC meetings in a non-
voting capacity. Each such JSC representative of a Party will have sufficient seniority within such Party to make decisions arising within
the scope of the JSC’s responsibilities. The Parties’ initial representatives to the JSC will be provided to each other Party within thirty (30)
days after the Effective Date. The JSC may change its size from time to time by mutual consent of its members. Each Party may replace
its JSC representatives at any time upon written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that neither Party may replace a
representative on the JSC with an individual with lower seniority without the approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The JSC shall meet at least two times each Calendar Year, and at least one such JSC meeting shall be in person/
face-to-face with alternating locations (for in person/ face-to-face meetings only), unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties.
Each Party may invite up to three (3) of its own employees, and the JSC may invite other non-members, to participate in the discussions
and meetings of the JSC, provided that such participants shall have no voting authority at the JSC. The JSC shall have two (2) co-
chairpersons, one from each Party. The role of the co-chairpersons shall be to convene and preside at meetings of the JSC. The Alliance
Managers shall work with the co-chairpersons to prepare and circulate agendas and to ensure the preparation of minutes. The co-
chairpersons shall have no additional powers or rights beyond those held by the other JSC representatives.
(c) Specific Responsibilities of the JSC . In addition to its overall responsibility for monitoring and providing strategic oversight with
respect to the Parties’ activities under this Agreement, the JSC shall in particular: (i) oversee the collaborative efforts of the Parties under
this Agreement; (ii) review and discuss the research, development and commercialization of Miltenyi Products and Bellicum Products,
including regulatory matters related thereto; (iii) attempt to resolve Disputes presented by the Alliance Managers; and (iv) perform such
other functions as appropriate to further the purposes of this Agreement, in each case, as agreed in writing by the Parties. The JSC has no
authority to modify this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or any Module.
ARTICLE 3 PRODUCT QUALITY; CHANGE CONTROL
3.1 Product Quality.
(a) Product Specifications . Miltenyi shall manufacture or have manufactured the Miltenyi Products to meet the agreed Product
Specifications, as then in effect, as published by Miltenyi from time to time, or as set forth in the Quality Agreement, as applicable.
(b) Agreed Standards . All Miltenyi Products shall be manufactured and quality controlled in compliance with and pursuant to: (i) the
Agreed Standards, (ii) the requirements of the Quality Agreement, if applicable, and (iii) Applicable Laws.
(c) Testing. Miltenyi shall have standard analytical testing performed on each batch of Miltenyi Product to be shipped to Bellicum, in
accordance with Agreed Standards and the procedures described in the corresponding documentation, to verify that Miltenyi Product
meets Product Specifications and that it was manufactured in accordance with Agreed Standards and Applicable Laws.
(d) Quality System. All Miltenyi Products supplied under this Agreement shall be manufactured and quality controlled under an appropriate
quality system in accordance with Agreed Standards, as more fully described in the Quality Agreement (as applicable). Any subsequent
change to Miltenyi’s quality system that, as Bellicum can reasonably establish, would have or is likely to have a material effect on the
safety, efficacy, identity and/or quality of a Miltenyi Product or its Permitted Use, requires the Parties to discuss and agree upon each such
change in writing.
10Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
(e) Quality Agreement. Within [...***...] days from the Effective Date (or such longer period as agreed by the Parties in writing, but in
any event prior to the first delivery of Clinical Grade Product to Bellicum), the Parties shall enter into an agreement on mutually
acceptable, commercially reasonable terms that details the quality assurance obligations of each Party relating to Clinical Grade Products
(the “Quality Agreement”). In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Quality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that the Quality Agreement shall govern in respect of quality issues.
3.2 Change Control.
(a) General. Subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this Section 3.2 and in the Quality Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed
between the Parties in writing from time to time, Miltenyi reserves the right to periodically make changes to the Product Specifications,
Agreed Standards and/or otherwise with respect to the properties, manufacture and/or testing of the Miltenyi Products (including changes
with respect to: suppliers of raw materials; quality in raw materials; methods of manufacturing; packaging; equipment and/or premises;
Subcontractors; product control techniques and methods of analysis; product release specifications; and/or presentation and content of
relevant documentation, including certificates pursuant to Section 6.5) from time to time during the Term (each, a “ Change”).
(b) Change Notification. Change notifications shall be provided in accordance with the applicable notification procedures set forth in the
Quality Agreement or in this Agreement. In the event that Miltenyi proposes a Material Change, unless such proposed Change is a
Required Change pursuant to Section 3.2(c) below and there are compelling reasons for earlier implementation of such Required Change,
Miltenyi shall give Bellicum at least [...***...] months’ advance written notice prior to implementation of the proposed Material Change (a
“Change Notification”). Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum all information
reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority regarding any Change under this
subsection, if applicable.
(c) Changes Required for Compliance . If during the Term a Change is required to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by
Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of a Regulatory Authority, or if Miltenyi determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that a Change is required to address safety and/or quality issues in regard to the Miltenyi Product generally (in each case, a
“Required Change”), Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Required Change at its cost. However, in the event that a Required
Change is specifically related to the use of Miltenyi Product for a Permitted Use in relation to a Bellicum Product (a “ Bellicum-Specific
Required Change”), then Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Bellicum-Specific Required Change only if and to the extent
Bellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of any such
Bellicum-Specific Required Change. Prior to implementing a Required Change in accordance with this Section 3.2(c), Miltenyi shall
promptly advise Bellicum as to any scheduling and/or Product Price adjustments which may result from any such Required Change, if
any. Miltenyi and Bellicum shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to reach agreement on (i) the new Product Price, if any, for any
Miltenyi Product which embodies such Required Change, giving due consideration to the effect of such change on Miltenyi’s
manufacturing costs for the changed Miltenyi Product as well as any other relevant factors, (ii) the responsibility for any costs and
expenses associated with Miltenyi’s activities required to implement such Change, and (iii) any other amendments to this Agreement which
may be necessitated by such Change (e.g., an adjustment to the lead time for firm orders). For clarity, Miltenyi shall have no obligation to
implement a Bellicum-Specific Required Change unless and until the Parties have reached agreement on all items as described in the
preceding sentence.
(d) Changes Requested by Bellicum . If during the Term Bellicum desires Miltenyi to make any Change not necessary to comply with
changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory
11Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a “Bellicum-Requested Change”), Bellicum
shall notify Miltenyi thereof in writing. Implementation of any such proposed Bellicum-Requested Change shall be subject to Miltenyi’s
consent. Miltenyi may withhold its consent to an Bellicum-Requested Change if Miltenyi reasonably determines that such change (i) does
not comply with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws or the requirements of Miltenyi’s applicable Regulatory Authority, or (ii) could have
potential adverse impact on Miltenyi’s manufacturing activities or the sale of the respective Miltenyi Product to other customers. In
addition, a Bellicum-Requested Change shall only be implemented following a technical and cost review which shall be conducted as
promptly as is reasonably possible and in good faith by Miltenyi, at Bellicum’s cost, and shall be subject to Miltenyi and Bellicum reaching
agreement as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product Price necessitated by any such Bellicum-Requested Change. If Bellicum
agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of the proposed Bellicum-
Requested Change and accepts a proposed Product Price adjustment that reflects a change in Miltenyi manufacturing costs resulting from
such Bellicum-Requested Change, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement the proposed Bellicum-Requested Change. For clarity, an
agreed adjustment to the Product Price shall become effective only with respect to orders for Miltenyi Products that are manufactured in
accordance with the Bellicum-Requested Change.
(e) Changes Requested by Miltenyi . If during the Term Miltenyi wishes to make any Material Change not necessary to comply with
changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each
case, a “ Miltenyi-Requested Change”), Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in accordance with the Change Notification procedures set forth in
Section 3.2(b) and the Quality Agreement before implementation of such Miltenyi-Requested Change (including at least 6 months advance
written notice prior to implementation), and shall keep Bellicum advised of its efforts to effectuate such change. Miltenyi shall use its best
efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reaosnable number of samples of the “ Changed Miltenyi Product ” (meaning such
Miltenyi Product that is produced under conditions of the Miltenyi-Requested Change) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as such
Changed Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant
documentation and shall provide to Bellicum any information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the
applicable Regulatory Authority for Bellicum to obtain any required amendment or other modification of the Bellicum Product regulatory
approvals regarding changes under this subsection, if applicable. Miltenyi shall implement such Miltenyi-Requested Change at its own cost
and expense. If Bellicum does not agree that such Changed Miltenyi Product is acceptable from Bellicum’s perspective, then any
limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi
Products affected by such Miltenyi-Requested Change shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such
Changed Miltenyi Products.
(f) Cooperation. In connection with any Change pursuant to this Section 3.2, the Parties shall cooperate, share information, and otherwise
act in good faith to prepare the appropriate documentation as may be necessary to secure and maintain appropriate regulatory approvals or
manufacturing permits for Miltenyi Product and Bellicum Product, respectively.
(g) Continued Supply. Except in the event of a Required Change, or other circumstances requiring the prompt implementation of a
proposed Material Change (as such circumstances and prompt implementation are notified to Bellicum in writing and if requested by
Bellicum, discussed with Bellicum in good faith), Miltenyi shall continue to supply Miltenyi Product without the proposed Material Change
for as long a period as is reasonably required for Bellicum, using [...***...], to make all appropriate filings and obtain any required
amendment or modification of existing regulatory approvals for Bellicum Product (unless otherwise agreed, such period not to exceed six
(6) months from the date of implementation of the Material Change as provided in Miltenyi’s Change Notification pursuant to Section
3.2(b)), subject to the Parties reaching agreement, as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product
12Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
Price necessitated by any such continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product during such period. Until such agreement is reached, any
limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi
Products described in this subsection (g) shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Miltenyi Products
produced after implementation of such Material Change. If the continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product under this subsection (g)
is reasonably estimated by the Parties to exceed a period of six (6) months from the implementation date of the Material Change notified in
a Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b), then the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss in good faith how to remedy the
situation.
(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (e) and (g), in the event that Bellicum reasonably determines to reject a proposed
Material Change (including a Miltenyi-Requested Change), Miltenyi will continue to supply the applicable Miltenyi Product without such
change after expiry of the said 6-month period and during the Term of this Agreement, or until Bellicum has secured an alternate source of
supply from a Third Party manufacturer; provided, however, that the Parties will discuss in good faith, reflecting the change in
circumstances contemplated by this Section 3.2(h), and agree in writing upon commercially reasonable terms to be set forth in an
amendment to this Agreement to reflect any demonstrable increased cost and effort (if any) resulting from the manufacture of unchanged
Miltenyi Product solely for Bellicum, including (as an example) any applicable adjustments to Forecasts, Lead Times, production cycles,
batch sizes, Delivery Dates, Product Prices, or other relevant issues. If the Parties cannot reach agreement regarding such amendment,
any obligations of Bellicum in relation to a Forecast for the affected Miltentyi Product in months 7-12 of the applicable Monthly Forecast,
and any limitations regarding forecast variances, as each of these are set forth in Article 5, will not apply to a Miltenyi Product produced
after implementation of such Material Change (i.e., one that replaces such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product), and Miltenyi shall be
relieved from any obligations to supply such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product under this Agreement after the period described in the
first sentence of this subsection (h) ends. For clarity, in no event shall Miltenyi be required to manufacture, supply or sell an existing
Miltenyi Product to which a Required Change must be applied.
(i) Research Grade Products . The notification requirements of the second sentence of Section 3.2(b) of this Agreement with respect to
Material Changes and the obligations of Section 3.2(g) with respect to Continued Supply shall not apply to Research Grade Products.
(j) Costs. Bellicum shall have responsibility for any Regulatory Authority filing fees and other costs and expenses incurred by Bellicum in
connection with any filing or required amendment or other modification of regulatory approvals or consents for Bellicum Product resulting
from any Change pursuant this Section 3.2, if applicable.
ARTICLE 4 REGULATORY
4.1 Regulatory Responsibility.
(a) Bellicum Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Miltenyi Products that are solely reserved by Miltenyi under this
Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Bellicum will be solely responsible for all regulatory
activities with respect to any Bellicum Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.
(b) Miltenyi Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Bellicum Product(s) that are solely reserved by Bellicum under this
Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Miltenyi will be solely responsible for all regulatory
activities with respect to any Miltenyi Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.
(c) Disclaimer. Bellicum hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically set out with respect to any Miltenyi Product in the
Product Specifications or in the Quality Agreement, as
13Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
applicable, the Miltenyi Products have no approvals by Regulatory Authorities in the Territory for use in diagnostic or therapeutic
procedures or other clinical applications, or for any other use requiring compliance with any law or regulation regulating clinical,
diagnostic or therapeutic products or any similar product (hereinafter collectively referred to as “ Regulatory Laws ”). Bellicum further
acknowledges and agrees that Miltenyi Products have not yet been fully tested or validated for safety or effectiveness in connection with
Bellicum’s Permitted Use. Save as set out in the Product Specifications or the applicable Quality Agreement, it shall be the sole
responsibility of Bellicum to test and validate the Miltenyi Products for Bellicum’s contemplated Permitted Use hereunder and to take all
other actions necessary to establish compliance of Bellicum’s Permitted Use thereof with all regulatory requirements, and to ensure that
any Bellicum Product resulting from such Permitted Use meets all applicable safety, quality, or other regulatory requirements (including
Regulatory Laws), in each case prior to the first use of such Miltenyi Product.
(d) The Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder may not be used for any purpose that would require Regulatory Authority approvals or
consents unless such proper Regulatory Authority approvals or consents have been obtained. Bellicum agrees that if it elects to use, or
causes any Bellicum Subcontractor or Licensee to use, any Miltenyi Products for a purpose that would subject Miltenyi or such Miltenyi
Products to the jurisdiction of any Regulatory Laws, Bellicum will be solely responsible for obtaining any required Regulatory Authority
approvals or consents, and for otherwise ensuring that Bellicum’s (or its Subcontractors’ or Licensees’) use of such Miltenyi Products for
such purpose complies with such Regulatory Laws. Bellicum shall defend and indemnify Miltenyi and its Affiliates against any liability,
damage, loss or expense resulting from or arising out of Bellicum’s failure to obtain all necessary Regulatory Authority approvals or
consents or to comply with any Regulatory Laws in relation to Bellicum’s use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose.
4.2 Regulatory Authority Requirements. Miltenyi states that (i) Miltenyi is obliged by relevant Regulatory Authorities to keep a record of all
of its customer’s clinical trials that use Miltenyi Products (name and title of clinical trials, the official registration numbers, name and
addresses of the involved principal investigators and clinical trial centers as well as the corresponding formal document granting approval
of an IND (for example only, IND/CTA acknowledgement letter of the relevant Regulatory Authority(ies) involving the use of “IDE/CRR”-
labelled Miltenyi Products)) (regardless of whether such clinical trials are sponsored by Miltenyi or by any Third Party); and (ii) Miltenyi is
not permitted to provide “IDE/CRR”-labeled Miltenyi Products to customers in the United States for use in clinical trials if the IND or IDE
is not approved by the respective regulatory authority or rejected. . Miltenyi shall act and shall have no liability to Bellicum for acting in
accordance with the foregoing requirements. As used herein, “CTA” means a clinical trial application; “IDE” means an investigational
device exemption; and “IDE/CRR” references a certain subset of Miltenyi Products labeled with the “IDE/CRR” designation.
4.3 Regulatory Work. Miltenyi has established, or may from time to time establish, Master Files for one or more Miltenyi Products with
one or more Regulatory Authorities in the Territory. Miltenyi shall maintain each such Master File in accordance with Applicable Laws
(“Regulatory Work”). To the extent Bellicum requests that Miltenyi generate any additional Master File and/or add additional information to
any existing Master File, the provisions of Section 4.4 “Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services” below shall apply.
4.4 Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services . With respect to any Bellicum Product, Bellicum may request that Miltenyi provide
additional regulatory assistance beyond the scope of the Regulatory Work, and/or may request that Miltenyi perform additional services
(i.e. generation of additional supportive data for inclusion in a Master File) that alter, amend, or add to the Regulatory Work. Bellicum shall
submit each such request to Miltenyi with reasonable detail in writing. Any request that constitutes a material modification or increase in
scope of the Regulatory Work or an agreement for the provision of additional services shall require a written amendment to this
Agreement via the Bellicum Product- or Bellicum Program-specific Module  signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Such
amendment
14Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
shall specify in detail any modification or scope change of the Regulatory Work performed by Miltenyi, the appropriate compensation (if
any) or basis for such compensation to be paid to Miltenyi by Bellicum for the performance of such additional Regulatory Work assistance
or services, and the appropriate time schedule for completion of such additional Regulatory Work assistance or services. Upon executing
such written amendment, the additional Regulatory Work assistance or services shall be deemed included within Regulatory Work and
subject to the standards of performance described in this Agreement.
4.5 Master Files; Right to Cross Reference . Upon Bellicum’s written request, subject to Section 4.9, Miltenyi shall submit a cross
reference letter to the appropriate Regulatory Authority(ies) in any Designated Country in which Miltenyi maintains a Master File(s) for the
relevant Miltenyi Product(s), authorizing such Regulatory Authority(ies) to access and refer to such Master File(s) for the relevant
Miltenyi Product(s) to the extent such information is reasonably required for regulatory purposes to obtain the applicable regulatory
approvals for the Permitted Use of the Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the Bellicum Product(s); provided, however, that Bellicum shall first
provide to Miltenyi all necessary information about such Bellicum Product that is reasonably included in such cross reference letter.
4.6 Rights to Master Files. Miltenyi shall solely own and retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Master File(s) (and any pertaining
regulatory documentation). Bellicum shall have no right to access the Master File(s), or, except as expressly set forth in Section 4.5 supra,
to require the disclosure by Miltenyi of any information contained in any Master File, or to cross-reference or otherwise use the Master
File(s) for any purpose other than as expressly provided herein.
4.7 Communication to/from Regulatory Authorities.
(a) Communication from Regulatory Authorities. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing of any material communication
from any Regulatory Authority that is related specifically to (i) the safety and/or functionality of any Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the use
thereof for the manufacture of Bellicum Product or (ii) the safety and/or functionality of any Bellicum Product(s) as the same relate or
could relate to a Miltenyi Product and/or the use of Miltenyi Product(s) in the manufacture of Bellicum Product(s), and that would, in
each case of (i) and (ii), reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either Party’s products that are the subject matter of
this Agreement, or ability of a Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (collectively, “ Communication(s)”). Each Party
shall, as soon as practicable after any contact with or receipt of any Communication, forward a copy or description of the same (to the
extent it so relates) to the other Party. Each Party reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party
information from such Communications. Each Party shall obligate its Affiliates and Subcontractors accordingly.
(b) Communication to Regulatory Authorities. In the event that a response to a Regulatory Authority is required in connection with any
Communication, Bellicum will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory
Authority in connection with any regulatory submission regarding a Bellicum Product, or any non-Miltenyi Product component thereof
(Miltenyi will provide its proposed response regarding any Miltenyi Product component thereof), and any non-product-specific
information and/or non-procedure-specific information related to Bellicum, and Miltenyi will have sole responsibility for the form and
content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority regarding a Miltenyi Product regulatory submission or any
component thereof, the Master Files, and any non-product specific information related to Miltenyi. If Miltenyi’s response is requested and
needed in connection with any Bellicum Product regulatory submission, and a delayed response is likely to delay development or
commercialization of such Bellicum Product, then Miltenyi will promptly use its diligent efforts to provide such response as soon as
practicable. At the responding Party’s reasonable request and expense, the other Party will collaborate in good faith with the responding
Party in preparing such responses and, subject to Sections 4.5 and 4.6, will provide the responding
15Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
Party with information that the responding Party reasonably believes is required to develop a requested response for questions in relation
to such Communication.
(c) Required Communications. If Bellicum is required to communicate with any Regulatory Authority specifically regarding any Miltenyi
Product, then Bellicum shall so advise Miltenyi as soon as practicable and, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, or to the extent that such
a disclosure would result in the violation of any contractual obligations to a Third Party, provide Miltenyi in advance with a copy of any
proposed written Communication with such Regulatory Authority to the extent that such Communication pertains to Miltenyi Products;
provided that Bellicum reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such copy.
Bellicum shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all reasonable direction of Miltenyi pertaining to the foregoing. To the extent permitted
by the Regulatory Authority, Miltenyi shall have the right to participate in any planned oral Communications or meetings between Bellicum
and any Regulatory Authority specifically relating to Miltenyi Products or Miltenyi Technology. For purposes of clarification, the
obligations imposed on Bellicum pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) shall not apply with respect to Communications with Regulatory
Authorities that are focused primarily on a non-Miltenyi Product portions or on a Bellicum Product.
4.8 Assistance. Miltenyi shall, if requested by Bellicum, consult with and provide reasonable assistance to Bellicum with regard to
regulatory matters concerning the Miltenyi Products, as appropriate, provided that for any assistance regarding regulatory matters that is
beyond the scope of standard use of the Miltenyi Products as made available in Miltenyi’s catalogue, Bellicum shall pay for Miltenyi’s time
for such consulting and assistance at Miltenyi’s then-standard rates, which scope and limits shall be discussed between the Parties and
mutually agreed in writing prior to the performance of the assistance by Miltenyi (subject to the Parties’ representations, warranties and
liabilities under this Agreement). Absent Miltenyi’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, Bellicum shall bear all responsibility for
Bellicum’s or Bellicum Subcontractors’ use of information provided by Miltenyi (including use in regulatory filings and any Third Party
liability) pursuant to this Section 4.8.
4.9 Additional Filings. Bellicum acknowledges that, as of the Effective Date, Master Files in relation to Miltenyi’s supply obligations have
not been filed in all jurisdictions worldwide. If Bellicum desires to pursue clinical evaluations related to the approvability or approval of any
Bellicum Product or decides to pursue commercialization of any Bellicum Product in any jurisdiction where Miltenyi does not then have an
active Master File, and Bellicum would not legally be able to conduct such evaluation or commercialization without Miltenyi filing a Master
File in such jurisdiction or making necessary information available to the Regulatory Authority, then Bellicum shall so notify Miltenyi, and
the Parties shall discuss in good faith the terms and conditions under which Miltenyi would be willing to file such Master File or provide
necessary information to the Regulatory Authority including additional compensation to Miltenyi (if any), but Miltenyi shall not be obligated
to file such Master File or provide such information, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing on such commercially reasonable terms
and conditions. To the extent requested by Bellicum in writing from time to time to amend the Bellicum Product specific Module to include
Additional Countries, Miltenyi shall work in good faith with Bellicum to include such Additional Countries in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.3 supra.
4.10 Disclaimer. Except as provided in this Article 4 or otherwise in the Agreement, Miltenyi provides no warranty that any Master File or
other regulatory dossier or submission by Miltenyi or Bellicum will be approved by any Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall in no way be
held responsible for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority or ethics committee to grant permission to conduct a clinical trial(s) and/or
for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority to grant approval under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or under a Biological
License Application (BLA) or for compassionate use for a Bellicum Product.
16Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
ARTICLE 5 FORECASTS AND ORDERS
5.1 Forecasts . In order to assist Miltenyi with its capacity, procurement and production planning, and as a general framework for
forecasting Bellicum’s orders of Miltenyi Products (where more specific parameters may be set forth in a given Module), Bellicum agrees
to provide Miltenyi with rolling forecasts of Bellicum’s (and its Subcontractors’ and Licensees’) anticipated quantity requirements for
Miltenyi Products in the Forecast Territory during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1
(each, a “ Forecast”). There is no binding forecasting obligation for Research Grade Products, except (if applicable) as otherwise explicitly
agreed in a Module. Any modified forecasting terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program that supplement
this Article 5 will be set forth in the Module applicable to that Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program. All of the Forecasts provided under
this Agreement will break down the demand of Miltenyi Products on a product-by-product (expressed in number of units) and
manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis (i.e., Forecast Territory only) and substantially follow the mutually agreed
Miltenyi forecast sheet, as attached hereto in Exhibit C 1-3. All Forecasts provided by Bellicum will be good faith estimates of Bellicum’s
anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products during the relevant period. Bellicum agrees to use [...***...] in preparing all
Forecasts provided hereunder to minimize variances between Forecasts. Each Forecast shall be duly signed by an authorized
representative of Bellicum (or Bellicum’s designee on behalf of Bellicum) and submitted in writing to Miltenyi, by mail, email or facsimile,
and shall supersede prior Forecasts to the extent the Forecast overlaps with prior Forecasts.
(a) Rolling Monthly Forecast; Firm Zone . Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of
each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a monthly rolling Forecast of Bellicum’s anticipated quantity requirements for
Miltenyi Products within the Forecast Territory (on a manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis) for each of the next twelve
(12) consecutive Calendar Months (e.g., year 1: months 1-12), commencing with the Calendar Month in which such Forecast is
submitted (each, a “ Monthly Forecast”). (For clarity, the initial Monthly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 1, i.e., Calendar Months 1-12;
the following Monthly Forecast will cover the twelve Calendar Months period following the Calendar Month 1 of the previous Monthly
Forecast, i.e., Calendar Months 2-13.) The Monthly Forecast shall show quantities forecasted on a monthly basis, and for the first (1 st)
three (3) months shall state the desired dates of Delivery for the forecasted quantities. With respect to any Monthly Forecast for Miltenyi
Products submitted during the Term, [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the quantities forecasted for the first (1 st) three (3) month period
of each Monthly Forecast (each such 3-month period will be referred to as the “ Firm Zone”) shall be binding, and the corresponding
portion of each subsequent Monthly Forecast shall be consistent with such period. For clarity, all forecasted quantities of Miltenyi
Products during the Firm Zone shall constitute a binding commitment by Bellicum to submit corresponding Purchase Orders for Miltenyi
Products. The Parties agree that, except with respect to the Firm Zone and any additional conditions set forth in a given Module, a
Monthly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.
(b) Rolling Quarterly Forecast. Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of each last
month of a Calendar Quarter during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a non-binding quarterly rolling Forecast of Bellicum’s anticipated
quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the four (4) Calendar Quarters immediately following the last month of such
Calendar Quarter (each, a “ Quarterly Forecast ”). Each Quarterly Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on a quarterly
basis. (For clarity, the initial Quarterly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 2, i.e. Calendar Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 (covering Calendar Months
13-15, 16-18, 19-21 and 22-24); the following Quarterly Forecast will cover the four Calendar Quarter period following the Calendar
Quarter 1 of the previous Quarterly Forecast, i.e. Calendar Quarters 2-5.) A Quarterly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding
upon both Parties.
17Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
(c) Long-Term Forecast. In addition, Bellicum (or Bellicum’s designee on behalf of Bellicum) shall within [...***...] days of the Effective
Date, and thereafter by [...***...] of each Calendar Year during the Term, submit a non-binding annual rolling Forecast of Bellicum’s
anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the next three (3) consecutive Calendar Years, commencing with the
Calendar Year in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a “ Long-Term Forecast”) for the purposes of assisting Miltenyi with its capacity
and production planning for Miltenyi Products during such period. Each Long-Term Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements
on an annual basis. (For clarity, the initial Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years 3 to 5; the following Long-Term Forecast
will cover the Calendar Years period following the previous Calendar Year 3 of the previous Long-Term Forecast, i.e. Calendar Years 4-5.)
A Long Term Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties and shall serve to assess future capacity planning at
Miltenyi.
(d) Forecasts Due Periodically. In the event that Miltenyi has failed to receive an updated Forecast for any relevant forecast period within
the times or by the dates provided in clauses (a) through (c) above, Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of such failure in writing and,
if Bellicum fails to respond with an updated Forecast by the [...***...] day of a Calendar Month of the relevant forecast period, the most
recent Forecast shall be regarded as current.
(e) Acceptable Forecast Variance. Outside the Firm Zone, Bellicum may increase or decrease the amount of Miltenyi Product forecast for
each Calendar Month of each Monthly Forecast by up to [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 4 through 6, and by
[...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 7 through 12, compared to the amount of Miltenyi Product that was forecast for the
comparable Calendar Month in the prior Monthly Forecast provided in accordance with this Agreement, on a product-by-product and
country-by-country basis, (e.g., the forecast for the fourth Calendar Month in a Monthly Forecast may not increase or decrease by more
than [...***...]% of the amount of any particular Miltenyi Product in any particular country forecast for the fifth Calendar Month of the
prior Monthly Forecast). For clarity, variances with respect to forecasts submitted for any Calendar Month within the Firm Zone shall not
be acceptable.
5.2 Volume Limitations.
(a) Subject to Bellicum’s adherence to its Forecast obligations pursuant to Section 5.1 above, or as specifically modified in a specific
Module, Miltenyi shall meet the demands of any Purchase Orders (as defined below) that are made by Bellicum in compliance with the
Forecasts. Miltenyi shall not be obligated to supply Bellicum with quantities of Miltenyi Product in excess of [...***...] percent
([...***...]%) of the most recent Forecast provided to Miltenyi but agrees to use [...***...] to satisfy Bellicum’s requirement of Miltenyi
Product in excess of [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the relevant Forecast quantities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it is or will be unable to supply any desired quantity of Miltenyi Product pursuant to a
Purchase Order that falls within the relevant Forecast on or before the applicable Delivery date(s) therefor, Miltenyi shall promptly inform
Bellicum, and then, the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery. If Miltenyi fails to propose a
reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery, Bellicum may, to be determined in Bellicum’s reasonable discretion and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Agreement, at its option, cancel the Purchase Order.
5.3 Firm Zone Requirements . Unless otherwise set forth in a relevant Module, the quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) forecasted for each
Calendar Month of the Firm Zone of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast submitted pursuant to Section 5.1(a) of this Agreement
shall be binding on both Parties, commencing on the Effecctive Date of the Agreement (but not for the first three months thereto), and in
each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall have the firm obligation to order at a minimum the amount of Miltenyi Product(s)
specified for the first (1 st) Calendar Month of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast
18Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
(such amount, the “ Firm Zone Requirements”). The Firm Zone Requirement shall not apply within the first three months of the Effective
Date of the Agreement. Within [...***...] days of the end of each Calendar Quarter, Miltenyi will calculate the total Firm Zone
Requirements for each of the three (3) Calendar Months during that Calendar Quarter. In the event that Bellicum fails to order the Firm
Zone Requirements of Miltenyi Product from Miltenyi during any particular Calendar Month in the relevant Calendar Quarter in which
Miltenyi was ready, willing and able to Deliver Miltenyi Product in accordance with the applicable Monthly Forecast, then the “Firm Zone
Order Shortfall” shall be the total amount by which the Firm Zone Requirements for any given Calendar Month during such Calendar
Quarter exceed the amount of Miltenyi Product actually ordered by Bellicum during such Calendar Month. Miltenyi will invoice Bellicum
for an amount equal to the Firm Zone Shortfall and Bellicum will pay such invoice within [...***...] days of the invoice date. Upon
Bellicum’s request and subject to payment of the Firm Zone Shortfall amount by Bellicum, Miltenyi will, if so requested by Bellicum,
provide Bellicum with Miltenyi’s remaining stock of the relevant forecasted Miltenyi Products equal in value to such Firm Zone Shortfall
amount.
5.4 Purchase Orders . This Section 5.4 sets forth a general framework for Purchase Order-related terms and conditions, which shall apply
unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module.
(a) Bellicum shall order Miltenyi Products by submitting written purchase orders to Miltenyi, in such form as the Parties may agree from
time to time and in accordance with any applicable Lead Times and the provisions of this Article 5 (each, a “ Purchase Order ”). All
Purchase Orders (and any related acceptances or objections by Miltenyi) may be delivered electronically or by other means to Miltenyi’s
applicable sales representative located in the country of the shipping destination or to such location as Miltenyi shall reasonably designate
from time to time.
(b) Each Purchase Order will specify the MB Global Contract Number assigned to this Agreement, the volumes of Miltenyi Product(s)
ordered, the desired Delivery date(s) the Miltenyi Products are to be made available to Bellicum for pick-up by Bellicum's designated
carrier or freight forwarder, the relevant ship-to address, and any special shipping instructions. Bellicum will order Miltenyi Product in a
defined number of units, subject to reasonable minimum order size requirements that may vary according to product type.
(c) Bellicum shall submit each Purchase Order to Miltenyi reasonably prior to the desired Delivery date(s), which shall be no sooner than
the applicable Lead Time(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s); provided that absent an applicable Lead Time, the Purchase Order shall be
submitted at least [...***...] days in advance of the desired Delivery date specified in such Purchase Order; and provided further that
Miltenyi shall use diligent and good faith efforts to Deliver before the desiredDelivery date.
(d) Purchase Orders shall be firm and binding upon written acceptance by Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall confirm acceptance of the Purchase
Order by written notice (sent by fax, mail, overnight courier or e-mail) to Bellicum within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of the
Purchase Order from Bellicum. If Miltenyi fails to confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of
the Purchase Order from Bellicum, then Bellicum will contact Miltenyi to verify Miltenyi’s receipt and acceptance of such Purchase Order
and request written confirmation thereof from Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall accept all Purchase Orders for quantities of Miltenyi Product that
are within the Firm Zone Requirement amounts specified for the relevant Calendar Month in the applicable Monthly Forecast.
(e) Each Purchase Order shall reference the MB Global Contract Reference Number (MBGCR) defined in the respective Modules,
submitted by Bellicum to Miltenyi shall be governed exclusively by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the relevant Module and
the applicable Quality Agreement. None of the terms and conditions set forth on any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance,
objection or similar document shall change or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Parties hereby agree that the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Module shall
19Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
supersede any conflicting term or condition set forth in any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similar
document furnished by Bellicum to Miltenyi or by Miltenyi to Bellicum, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchase Orders
may only contain products to be ordered under a single MBGCR. The combination of products referring to different MBGCR in one
Purchase Order, or a combination of products referencing a MBGCR and products not referencing a MBGCR in one Purchase Order is
not possible.
(f) In the event of a Bellicum Product safety issue, withdrawal or hold on use of a Bellicum Product by a Regulatory Authority or other
issue that directly results in a material reduction or elimination of Bellicum’s quantity requirements for a particular Miltenyi Product(s), the
Parties will discuss promptly and in good faith adjustments to the permitted forecast variance described in Section 5.1(e) during the period
when such circumstance exists, and other steps that could be taken to soften the impact of such circumstance on each Party.
5.5 Changes to Purchase Orders . Subject to Section 5.2 and applicable Lead Times, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to comply with unplanned
changes in Purchase Orders requested by Bellicum either in terms of quantities or Delivery dates. All requests for changes to Purchase
Orders shall be submitted in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all supplementary costs that result from the implementation of any
unplanned change to an accepted Purchase Order requested by Bellicum.
5.6 Minimum Purchases. This Section 5.6 sets forth a general framework for Minimum Purchases-related terms and conditions, which
shall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module. In the event
Bellicum’s aggregate purchases of Miltenyi Products from Miltenyi under this Agreement in any Calendar Year during the Term is less than
[...***...]% of the Rolling Monthly Forecast subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, at the beginning of that Calendar Year or €[...***...]
([...***...] Euros), whatever is higher, (the “ Minimum Purchase”), then Miltenyi shall provide written notice to Bellicum of such shortfall.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and for Calendar Year 2019 only, the €[...***...] amount recited as an element
used to determine the Minimum Purchase in a Calendar Year is hereby reduced to €[...***...]. Bellicum shall have [...***...] days to tender
a firm Purchase Order for the purchase of such shortfall to satisfy the Minimum Purchase requirements set forth above. If Bellicum fails
to tender such firm Purchase Order and has not otherwise met the Minimum Purchase requirements within said [...***...]-day period,
then Miltenyi, in its sole discretion, effective immediately upon Bellicum's receipt of written notice of Miltenyi's election to do so, shall
have no obligation to Bellicum under this Agreement:
(1) not to discontinue the supply of any particular Miltenyi Product;
(2) to use [...***...] to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum in accordance with Forecasts provided by or on behalf
of Bellicum; and
(3) to provide Regulatory Work in accordance with Section 4.3.
Minimum Purchases referred to above will include the quantities of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in accordance with applicable
Forecasts that could not be supplied by Miltenyi. At the time Bellicum reaches the Minimum Purchase requirements again, Miltenyi and
Bellicum shall in good faith agree to continue the supply commitment.
ARTICLE 6 DELIVERY
6.1 Delivery; Shipment.
(a) Each quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in a particular Purchase Order pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered
FCA (Incoterms 2010) Miltenyi’s Facility by delivery
20Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
of the shipped goods to Bellicum’s designated carrier or freight forwarder, in adequate packaging and ready for loading, on the Delivery
Date (“Delivery”).
(b) Each shipment of Miltenyi Products will be picked up by Bellicum’s designated carrier on the agreed delivery date(s) (each, a “Delivery
Date”) confirmed by Miltenyi for the applicable Purchase Order in accordance with applicable Lead Time(s), during normal business
hours (Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays) unless special arrangements are agreed to by Miltenyi in writing. Bellicum shall be
responsible for all arrangements regarding loading, shipment, insurance from Miltenyi’s Facility to the ultimate destination and import
customs clearances at the destination country, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing. Alternatively, upon Bellicum’s written
request, Miltenyi will make all necessary shipping arrangements on behalf of Bellicum with a carrier designated by Bellicum, on Bellicum’s
responsibility. Bellicum shall provide Miltenyi with a list of approved carriers. Bellicum also shall be responsible for all of the following
costs and charges, as applicable: loading charges of the designated carrier, freight charges and other shipping expenses from Miltenyi’s
Facility to the ultimate destination, expenses for insurance of goods during transit, import customs clearances.
(c) Upon Delivery, Bellicum will cause its carrier to verify the gross and visually observable physical integrity of all Miltenyi Product
packaging prior to loading and to acknowledge proper receipt of the Miltenyi Products by signing the relevant transport documentation.
(d) Miltenyi shall have the Miltenyi Products appropriately labelled with a traceable lot or batch number and packaged for shipping in
commercial packaging materials in compliance with Agreed Standards, Miltenyi’s standard procedures and, the applicable Quality
Agreement.
(e) Quantities actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum’s designee pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order may not vary from the
quantities reflected in such Purchase Order without Bellicums’ prior written consent; provided, however, that if Bellicum so consents to a
variance in quantities actually Delivered (as compared to quantities set forth in an accepted Purchase Order), Bellicum shall only be
invoiced and required to pay for the quantities of Miltenyi Product that Miltenyi actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum’s designee. In
the event that Bellicum consents to accept Delivery of less than the quantities of Miltenyi Product in an accepted Purchase Order, Miltenyi
shall include, in the next shipment of Miltenyi Product to Bellicum, any quantities ordered pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order but not
actually delivered on the designated Delivery date. If a delay in any such Delivery of Miltenyi Products exceeds ten (10) Days, then
Bellicum may require a pro rata reduction in its then-current Monthly Forecast to account for such delay.
6.2 Title and Risk. Title and risk of loss or damage to Miltenyi Products shall pass to Bellicum as defined by Incoterm FCA (Incoterms
2010). Should any of the Delivered Miltenyi Products be damaged during transit to Bellicum or Bellicum’s designee, then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 5.4, a replacement order to replace such damaged Miltenyi Products shall be fulfilled, even if the
volume limitations defined in Section 5.2 are exceeded, by Miltenyi in good faith and as soon as practicable (and such replacement order
shall be considered a new Purchase Order during the applicable Firm Zone).
6.3 Partial Delivery. With Bellicum’s specific prior written consent, Miltenyi may make partial shipment against Purchase Orders, to be
separately invoiced with each shipment and paid for when due in accordance with this Agreement. For such partial shipments, Miltenyi
will pay all shipment costs associated with such subsequent or additional shipments.
6.4 Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life. Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of Delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped Miltenyi
Product shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B as such Exhibit B Module may be amended from time to time by
written notification of Miltenyi to Bellicum. As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is
relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed
21Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
ordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...]
to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b)
improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree to
provide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into account
cost, resource and capacity requirements.
6.5 Certificates. Miltenyi shall include proper release certificates, certificates of compliance, and/or certificates of analysis with all
shipments of Miltenyi Product, as applicable, in accordance with the requirements of the Quality Agreement.
6.6 Product Shortage . Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of any potential or anticipated shortfall in the manufacturing or inventory of
any Miltenyi Product that may adversely affect the Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with Bellicum’s forecast requirements
and pending Purchase Orders therefor. If Miltenyi is unable to supply any Miltenyi Product subject to a pending Purchase Order for any
reason, then the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery and Miltenyi shall undertake prompt and
diligent efforts to mitigate the adverse impact on Bellicum. In the case of a limited availability of any Miltenyi Product, in selling such
Miltenyi Product, Miltenyi shall take into account the aggregate volume of Miltenyi Products purchased by Bellicum, and shall subject to
reasonable ethical standards provide to Bellicum priority access to Miltenyi Product consistent with such Miltenyi Product purchase
volumes and critical medical needs. If due to the fault or error of Miltenyi or a Third-Party supplier or Subcontractor of Miltenyi or Force
Majeure, Miltenyi fails to deliver any Miltenyi Product in the quantities specified in Bellicum's Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall use all
[...***...] that may be necessary in order to minimize the shortfall, and deliver the ordered Miltenyi Product as soon as possible. If
Miltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery or if the delay is more than thirty (30) days following the confirmed
Delivery Date, Bellicum may, at its reasonable election and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, cancel the Purchase
Order(s) without penalty.
6.7 Continuity of Supply.
(a) Contingent upon Bellicum’s continued adherence to its obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including the Forecast
obligations and Firm Zone Requirements pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.3 above, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] have and devote adequate
manufacturing capacity to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Belicum in accordance with the Forecasts during the Term,
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.7. However, Miltenyi’s compliance with this Section 6.7(a) shall not require Miltenyi to
incur any significant expenses to purchase new equipment, to install equipment purchased or requested by Bellicum, or to add (or, for
clarity, allocate or dedicate) additional manufacturing or storage capacity for the manufacturing and supply of Miltenyi Products to
Bellicum hereunder.
(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it will not be able, or is likely not to be able, to produce all of Bellicum’s forecast
requirements of Miltenyi Products from its primary facility located in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, Miltenyi shall determine, at its option
and expense, to establish additional or alternative manufacturing and supply capability for the Miltenyi Products by qualifying and
maintaining one or more back-up manufacturing facilities at the premises of Miltenyi and/or any of its Affiliates (each, a “Secondary
Location”). Use of a Secondary Location must be notified to Bellicum in writing in accordance with the Change Notification processes set
forth in Section 3.2. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reasonable number of samples of the
“Secondary Location Miltenyi Products” (meaning such Miltenyi Products that are produced at such Secondary Location) for evaluation
by Bellicum as soon as each such Secondary Location Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. In the event
that Miltenyi decides to qualify a Secondary Location for the supply of Miltenyi Products hereunder, it shall provide reasonable prior
written notice thereof (not less than
22Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
six (6) months in advance) to Bellicum, including such details as Bellicum reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of such
Secondary Location. Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for all activities in connection with the setup and approval of the Secondary
Location, including for establishing proof of product equivalence for Miltenyi Products produced at the Secondary Location, process and
equipment validation and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with Miltenyi’s applicable Regulatory Authorities in connection
with the Secondary Location.
(c) In addition, Miltenyi may from time to time determine, in its sole discretion, to have one or more Miltenyi Products manufactured,
assembled and/or supplied, in whole or in part, by a Subcontractor chosen by Miltenyi and reasonably acceptable to Bellicum. Miltenyi
shall provide Bellicum with prior written notification of such Change in accordance with the applicable notification procedures as set forth
in the Section Change Control and in the Quality Agreement, if applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Miltenyi shall remain responsible
for the fulfilment of its supply and other obligations hereunder with respect to any Miltenyi Product manufactured by Miltenyi’s
Subcontractor. Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or other
correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a Third
Party subcontractor site for the Miltenyi Products. Further, Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for all process and equipment validation
required by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass
government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities
(d) In addition, the Parties shall from time to time discuss in good faith and mutually and reasonably agree upon (i) whether one or more
Miltenyi Products require a minimum inventory to be held by Bellicum, and (ii) whether there shall be any type of Miltenyi Product that
require a minimum inventory to be held by Miltenyi on behalf of Bellicum and under which terms and conditions such minimum inventory
shall be reserved for Bellicum.
6.8 Continuity of Supply - Commercial Phase.
If a given Module involves supply of Miltenyi Products for Bellicum’s Commercial Phase activities, Section 6.8(b) shall apply, provided
that additional terms and conditions regarding continuity of supply for such Commercial Phase activities pursuant to such Module have
been negotiated in good faith and mutually agreed upon in such Module. The Parties acknowledge that provisions in such Module relating
to additional terms and conditions regarding such continuity of supply will depend on the specific Miltenyi Product(s) that are relevant to
such Module, and further acknowledge that such provision(s) in such Module may be subject to the Parties’ good faith negotiation and
mutual agreement regarding additional terms and conditions relevant to minimum purchase requirements (if any) for Miltenyi Product(s)
under a Module.
(a) Principal Terms.
(1) In the event of a Supply Failure (as defined below), Bellicum shall have the option to request Miltenyi to establish, as soon as
reasonably feasible and at Miltenyi’s sole cost and expense, a Secondary Location reasonably capable of making up the Supply Failure of
the affected Miltenyi Product (the “Affected Miltenyi Product”), and if Miltenyi should either (i) notify Bellicum in writing that it is not
willing and/or capable to establish a Secondary Location, or (ii) should not have established such Secondary Location and made up the
Supply Failure within a reasonable period of time with regard to the Affected Miltenyi Product from receipt of Bellicum’s written request
therefore, then Bellicum shall, at Bellicum’s sole cost and expense, have the right to select, qualify, and maintain an additional second
source manufacturing facility as a back-up manufacturing facility for the Affected Miltenyi Products at the premises of a Third Party (the
“Second-Source Supplier”). In the event that Bellicum elects to qualify a Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product, it shall
provide Miltenyi with prior written notice to Miltenyi including such details as Miltenyi reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of
such Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall be subject to the prior written consent of Miltenyi, which
23Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as necessary in Miltenyi’s reasonable judgment to protect the bona fide
and legitimate interests of Miltenyi in protecting its proprietary Intellectual Property Rights from misappropriation or misuse (e.g., by
disclosure to a Miltenyi Competitor). If Miltenyi so withholds its consent, it shall propose alternative Second-Source Suppliers reasonably
acceptable to both Miltenyi and Bellicum. If the Parties fail to identify a mutually acceptable Second-Source Supplier within thirty (30)
days, Bellicum may proceed with an alternative Second-Source Supplier of its choice (however not a Miltenyi Competitor) without
Miltenyi’s consent.
(2) For purposes hereof, each of the following events shall be deemed a “Supply Failure”:
(i) if Miltenyi, using [...***...], fails to deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi
Product basis) of an accepted Purchase Order of Miltenyi Product placed by Bellicum in accordance with the
relevant binding Forecast within a reasonable period of time after the agreed Delivery Date therefor (whether by
reason of Force Majeure or otherwise) more than twice during any Calendar Year; provided, however, that any of the
foregoing events shall not be considered a Supply Failure to the extent that it results from:
(x) an act or omission of Bellicum, including any specific written instructions or requirements issued by Bellicum, including an Bellicum-
Requested Change; or
(y) the failure or delay on the part of any supplier of materials designated and required by Bellicum or any other Subcontractor designated
and required by Bellicum; or
(z) a Required Change or other change in any material requirement relating to the development, manufacturing, packaging and shipping of
Miltenyi Product at Miltenyi’s facility required by Applicable Laws, or the imposition of any other condition with respect to the Miltenyi
Product by any governmental body or agency, or Regulatory Authority, based on Applicable Laws, or an event of Force Majeure, unless
Miltenyi fails to use [...***...] to remedy the failure, inability, or delay within a reasonable period of time. In the event of the foregoing
failures, inabilities, or delays, the Parties shall meet and discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.
(ii) If Miltenyi fails to Deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of an
accepted Purchase Order, then for that Miltenyi Product affected by such failed Delivery, the next step in the
Discount scheme set forth in Exhibit F shall be applied to such Miltenyi Product during the following two (2)
Calendar Quarters (and a repeated failure shall result in further step in the Discount scheme being applied in like
manner).
(3) In the event that Bellicum selects a Second-Source Supplier over Miltenyi’s reasonable objection, Miltenyi shall not be responsible to
Bellicum for the performance of the said Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall, as a condition of qualification,
provide reasonable and customary undertakings to Miltenyi related to the protection of Miltenyi’s Confidential Information. Bellicum shall
be primarily responsible, with Miltenyi’s reasonable cooperation and assistance, for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing
all submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek
approval of a manufacturing facility as Second-Source Supplier for Affected Miltenyi Product. Further, Bellicum shall be primarily
responsible, with Miltenyi’s reasonable assistance, for all process and equipment validation
24Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
required by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass
government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities.
(4) In the event of a Supply Failure, Miltenyi shall grant Bellicum’s Second-Source Supplier a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
one-site production license, without the right to sublicense, under Miltenyi’s Intellectual Property Rights solely to the extent reasonably
necessary to manufacture the Affected Miltenyi Product for the Permitted Use by Bellicum at Bellicum’s cost. For the avoidance of doubt,
a Second-Source Supplier’s license under this subsection shall not permit the manufacture of any Miltenyi Product that is not subject to
Supply Failure. A Second-Source Supplier’s license hereunder shall subsist until such time as Miltenyi and Bellicum reach agreement on
alternative license and/or supply arrangements which shall, inter alia, take into consideration: (i) Miltenyi’s interest in regaining control over
the manufacture of Miltenyi Products, (ii) Bellicum’s interest in securing continuity of supply of the Affected Miltenyi Product(s), (iii) the
costs incurred by Bellicum in establishing the Second-Source Supplier to rectify the applicable Supply Failure, (iv) the avoidance of

ARTICLE 7 ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION.
7.1 Acceptance Testing . Bellicum or (for Miltenyi Product purchased by Bellicum but shipped directly to a Bellicum’s Affiliate,
Subcontractor, or Licensee) Bellicum’s designated recipient of the
shipment of Miltenyi Product will promptly upon Delivery visually inspect each shipment of Miltenyi Product delivered hereunder to (i)
determine whether such Miltenyi Product is damaged and (ii) verify that the quantity of Miltenyi Product delivered conforms with the
Purchase Order and other applicable documentation. Further, Bellicum shall have a period of [...***...] days from the date of Delivery to
25Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
perform, or have its Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee (as the case may be) perform, incoming quality assurance testing on each
shipment of Miltenyi Product in accordance with the Bellicum-approved quality control testing procedures as set forth in the Product
Specifications or the Quality Agreement, as applicable (the “ Testing Methods”), to verify conformance with the Product Specifications.
For the avoidance of doubt, Bellicum shall have no obligation under this Section 7.1 to inspect or test the contents of the Miltenyi
Products other than as in accordance with the agreed Testing Methods, save as prescribed by Applicable Laws.
7.2 Rejection. Bellicum or its designee shall have the right to reject any shipment of Miltenyi Products that does not conform with the
applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty at the time of Delivery when tested in accordance with the Testing Methods (each, a “ Rejected
Product”). Except in the case of latent defects as described in Section 7.3, each shipment of Miltenyi Products shall be deemed accepted
by Bellicum if Bellicum or its designated recipient of the shipment does not provide Miltenyi with written notice of rejection (a “ Rejection
Notice”) within [...***...] days from the date of receipt of the relevant shipment of Miltenyi Product, describing the reasons for the
rejection and the non-conforming characteristics of such Rejected Product in reasonable detail. Once a Delivery of Miltenyi Products is
accepted or deemed accepted hereunder, Bellicum shall have no recourse against Miltenyi in the event any such Miltenyi Product is
subsequently deemed unsuitable for use for any reason, except for Miltenyi Product that does not conform to the Miltenyi Product
Warranty after said 30-day period due to a latent defect in the Miltenyi Product that could not be detected through the performance of the
Testing Methods.
7.3 Latent Defects . Bellicum shall have the further right to reject such quantities of Miltenyi Product accepted or deemed accepted
pursuant to Section 7.2 above by providing a Rejection Notice on the grounds that all or part of the shipment fails to comply with the
Miltenyi Product Warranty to the extent such non-conformance could not have reasonably been determined by visual inspection or
incoming quality assurance testing in accordance with Section 7.1, provided that the applicable shelf-life of the Miltenyi Product has not
expired and such non-conformance is unrelated to the shipping or storage of the Miltenyi Product after Delivery. The rejection provisions
of Section 7.2 above shall apply. Notification to Miltenyi by Bellicum must occur within [...***...] days after Bellicum or Bellicum’s
designated recipient of the shipment becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware that the Miltenyi Product fails to comply
with the Miltenyi Product Warranty.
7.4 Confirmation. After its receipt of a Rejection Notice from Bellicum or its designee pursuant to Section 7.2, Miltenyi shall notify
Bellicum in writing as soon as reasonably practical whether or not it accepts Bellicum’s basis for rejection, and Bellicum shall reasonably
cooperate with Miltenyi in determining in good faith whether such rejection was necessary or justified. Upon Miltenyi’s reasonable
request, Bellicum shall provide, or cause its designees to provide, (i) evidence of appropriate transport, storage and handling for any
Rejected Product in accordance with the storage and handling instructions set forth in the applicable Product Specifications; and (ii)
reasonable testing data demonstrating that the Miltenyi Product in question does not conform to the Miltenyi Product Warranty. If the
Parties are unable to agree as to whether a shipment of Miltenyi Products supplied by Miltenyi hereunder conforms to the applicable
Miltenyi Product Warranty, such question shall be submitted to an independent quality control laboratory mutually agreed upon by the
Parties. The findings of such independent quality control laboratory shall be binding upon the Parties. The cost of the independent quality
control laboratory shall be borne by the Party whose results are shown by such laboratory to have been incorrect.
7.5 Return or Destruction of Rejected Products . Bellicum may not return or destroy any batch of Miltenyi Products until it receives
written notification from Miltenyi that Miltenyi does not dispute that such batch fails to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product
Warranty. Miltenyi will indicate in its notice either that Bellicum is authorized to destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products, or that
Miltenyi requires return of the rejected Miltenyi Products. Upon written authorization from Miltenyi to do so, Bellicum shall promptly
destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products and provide Miltenyi with written certification of
26Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
such destruction. Upon receipt of Miltenyi’s request for return, Bellicum shall promptly return the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products to
Miltenyi. In each case, Miltenyi will reimburse Bellicum for the documented, reasonable costs associated with the destruction or return of
the rejected Miltenyi Products.
7.6 Replacement or Refund. Bellicum shall not be required to pay any invoice with respect to any shipment of Miltenyi Products properly
rejected pursuant to this Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bellicum shall be obligated to pay in full for any rejected shipment of
Miltenyi Products that is not returned or destroyed in accordance with Section 7.5 above, and that is subsequently determined to conform
to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, irrespective of whether Bellicum has already paid Miltenyi for a replacement shipment (but in
such event, the replacement shipment will be Delivered to Bellicum and will be included in Bellicum’s Minimum Purchases). If Bellicum
pays in full for a shipment of Miltenyi Products and subsequently properly rejects such shipment in accordance with Section 7.2, Bellicum
shall be entitled, upon confirmation that such shipment failed to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, either, at Bellicum’s
option: (i) to a refund or credit equal to the Product Price paid with respect to such rejected shipment (including without limitation, taxes
paid and shipping expenses); or (ii) to require Miltenyi to promptly replace and Deliver to Bellicum an amount of Miltenyi Products that
conforms to the requirements of this Agreement at no additional cost to Bellicum. Bellicum acknowledges and agrees that Bellicum’s rights
to a refund or credit for, or to receive replacement of, properly rejected shipments of Miltenyi Products hereunder shall be Bellicum’s sole
and exclusive remedy, and Miltenyi’s sole obligation, with respect to non-conforming Miltenyi Products delivered hereunder.
7.7 Exceptions. Bellicum’s rights of rejection, return, refund and replacement set forth in this Article 7 shall not apply to any Miltenyi
Product that is non-conforming due to damage (i) caused by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, or Licensees or their respective
employees or agents, including but not limited to, misuse, neglect, improper storage, transportation or use beyond any dating provided, or
(ii) that occurs after Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with this Agreement, including any damage caused thereafter by
accident, fire or other hazard, and Miltenyi shall have no liability or responsibility to Bellicum with respect thereto.
ARTICLE 8 FINANCIAL TERMS
8.1 Upfront Payment. Following execution of this Agreement and within [...***...] days of Bellicum’s receipt of an invoice therefor, and

27Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
to supply Miltenyi Product to Bellicum under this Agreement for the Permitted Use; and further provided that amounts owed under such
Third Party license agreements have not otherwise been passed through to Bellicum and are actually paid by Miltenyi to Miltenyi’s
licensor(s). Bellicum acknowledges that the potential volume of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees under applicable Third Party
license agreements will be as set forth on Exhibit D, as updated from time to time by Miltenyi. If, during the Term of this Agreement, the
Parties mutually agree to obtain additional Third Party licenses to enable the Permitted Use of Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Affiliates,
Subcontractors, and/or Licensees under this Agreement, and such additional licenses give rise to Third Party royalties and/or license fees
with respect to Bellicum’s use of Miltenyi Products under this Agreement, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith which Party(ies)
is/are responsible for payment of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees. Miltenyi, acting reasonably, reserves the right to defer the
inclusion of additional Miltenyi Products in Exhibit B hereto until the Parties have reached agreement on this matter.
8.4 Pricing
(a) Product Price . In consideration of the supply and Delivery of Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement, Miltenyi
agrees to sell and Deliver and Bellicum agrees to purchase Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement at the Purchase
Price listed for each unit of a Miltenyi Product set forth on Exhibit E (the “Product Price ”).
(b) Tiered Pricing. Bellicum shall be entitled to a reduction of the Product Prices set forth in Exhibit F (collectively, the “Discounts”). The
Discount, as applicable to a particular Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year, shall be based on Bellicum’s and its Subcontractors’ and
Licensees’ consolidated volume purchases of such Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year. Within the first Calendar Year, Miltenyi shall
analyze Bellicum’s and its Subcontractors’ and Licensees’ purchases of Miltenyi Products at the end of each Calendar Quarter; if such
purchases for a particular Miltenyi Product exceed the volume threshold of the then applicable Discount (based on binding and firm
Purchase Orders received by Miltenyi in that Calendar Quarter), then, in the following Calendar Quarter, for all Purchase Orders regarding
such Miltenyi Product, the corresponding higher Discount level in accordance with the volume thresholds as defined in Exhibit F shall
apply. Subject to Bellicum reaching the Minimum Purchase requirements in accordcance with Section 5.6 in a Calendar Year, for the
subsequent Calandar Year, the Discount applicable for the first Discount volume threshold shall apply, beginning from the first Miltenyi
Product ordered by Bellicum under this Agreement during such subsequent Calendar Year.

Product in any given Contract Year during the Term. In case, after application of the applicable Discount, any Purchase Price increases
[...***...] percent ([...***...]%) annually, then the Parties shall consult each other, negotiate in good faith and agree in writing upon an
adaptation of the applicable Discount to stay within the capping of a [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) increase, except for cases when
such Purchase Price increase is the result of a documented increase of more than [...***...] ([...***...]%) in the cost of any raw
materials, packaging and/or other components used in the manufacture of Miltenyi Product and Miltenyi, at Bellicum’s request, has
provided reasonable documentation evidencing such changes in production costs. It is however expressly agreed between the Parties that
the adjusted Purchase Price charged to Bellicum for Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder shall in no event exceed Miltenyi’s then-current
list prices for such Miltenyi Product as in effect in the country of destination or use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, as published from
time to time in Miltenyi’s applicable product catalogue.
(d) Product Price Adjustments resulting from Changes.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations on Product Price increases
set forth in Section 8.3(c) above shall not apply to
28Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
Product Price adjustments resulting from a Required Change or a Bellicum-Requested Change pursuant to Section 3.2(d) hereof.
8.5 Payment Terms. The payment terms for all payments made by Bellicum for purchased Miltenyi Products shall be as follows:
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all undisputed and properly due payments are payable within [...***...] days of Bellicum’s receipt

percent ([...***...]%) per month, or if lower, the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law, on all undisputed and properly due
amounts not paid by Bellicum when due. Bellicum acknowledges that failure by Bellicum to comply with its payment obligations in this
Article 8 shall constitute a material breach.
(e) Except as expressly provided herein, Bellicum shall not exercise any right of setoff, net-out or deduction, take any credit, or otherwise
reduce the balance owed to Miltenyi with respect to any payments under this Agreement, unless the Parties otherwise agree or until
Bellicum has obtained a final and non-appealable judgment against Miltenyi in the amount asserted by Bellicum.
8.6 Taxes. All payments made under this Agreement shall be free and clear of any and all taxes, duties, levies, fees or other charges,
except for withholding taxes. Each Party shall be entitled to deduct from its payment to the other Party under this Agreement the amount
of any withholding taxes required to be withheld, to the extent paid to the appropriate governmental authority on behalf of the other Party
(and not refunded or reimbursed). Each Party shall deliver to the other Party, upon request, proof of payment of all such withholding
taxes. Each Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the other Party in seeking any benefits available to such Party with respect to
government tax withholdings by any relevant law, regulation or double tax treaty.

performance under this Agreement if and to the extent Bellicum materially fails to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement
and fails to cure such failure within five Business Days after confirmed receipt of a notice of breach from Miltenyi. For the avoidance of
doubt, the failure by Bellicum to make timely payments of any material, undisputed amount that is properly due Miltenyi under this
Agreement shall constitute a material failure of Bellicum to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement. Without prejudice to any
other right or remedy available to Bellicum, Bellicum shall have the right to suspend payment under this Agreement if and to the extent
Miltenyi materially fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

advance of any scheduled inspection of Miltenyi’s Facility by a Regulatory Authority.
9.4 Cost of Audits and Inspections . If Bellicum or or Bellicum’s Licensees conduct a Facility audit or inspection more than [...***...] in a
[...***...] month period, and such additional audits are not “for cause” audits, then Bellicum and its Licensees (as applicable) shall
reimburse Miltenyi for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a direct result of Facility audits and/or
inspections pursuant to Sections 9.1and 9.3 solely to the extent that they relate to the review of a Bellicum Product. For clarity, Bellicum

due to the Third Party for such license) or modify the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) so that the supplied Miltenyi Product(s) are no longer
infringing but have equivalent functionality. If Miltenyi fails to negotiate such license or modify the applicable Miltenyi Product, and to the
extent Bellicum reasonably determines, following consultation with Miltenyi, that it is obligated to take a royalty-bearing license under any
Third Party Intellectual Property Rights in order to avoid infringement of such Third Party Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the
use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, then Bellicum shall have the right to offset any payment actually made to the Third Party for such
license in any Contract Year against any Product Price payable to Miltenyi for the applicable Miltenyi Product in the same
33Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
Contract Year (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis), under the proviso that Bellicum provides Miltenyi with reasonably
satisfactory evidence of such Third Party royalties payment. The total amount of any reduction(s) pursuant to this Section 11.5(b) shall in
no event exceed [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the Product Price payable for the applicable Miltenyi Product in that Contract Year
(with the right to carry forward any unused offset).
(c) The foregoing shall be Bellicum’s sole and exclusive remedy and Miltenyi’s sole obligation with respect to claims that any Miltenyi
Product fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty or the warranties in Section 11.2. Miltenyi will not in any event be liable for
increased manufacturing costs, downtime costs, purchase of substitute products, lost profits, revenue, or goodwill, or any other indirect
incidental, special, or consequential damages caused by a breach of the Miltenyi Product Warranty or the warranties in Section 11.2.
ARTICLE 12 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
12.1 Limitation of Liability. Except for liability for (i) breach of the confidentiality obligations described in Article 14, (ii) misappropriation
or infringement by a Party of the other Party’s Intellectual Property Rights, or (iii) gross negligence or willful misconduct:
(a) IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, WHETHER IN AN
ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING ERRORS OR OMISSIONS OR BREACH OF WARRANTY), EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES;
(b) EACH PARTY’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO
DIRECT AND ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO ONE EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR
LOSSES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCT PRICES PAID BY BELLICUM FOR
THE MILTENYI PRODUCT(S) DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING
RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; AND FURTHER PROVIDED THAT SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY DURING SUCH PERIOD ALSO
SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF SUCH PARTY’S INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY.
12.2 No Liability for Clinical Trials. Bellicum shall have sole responsibility that any Bellicum Product is safe for human use, and Bellicum
hereby assumes sole risk and liability arising out of or in connection with the use of Bellicum Products in clinical trials by or on behalf of
Bellicum or commercialization of Bellicum Products (including product liability with respect thereto).
ARTICLE 13 INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE
13.1 Indemnification by Miltenyi. Miltenyi will save, defend and hold harmless Bellicum, its Licensees and Subcontractors and their
respective officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents (collectively, “ Bellicum Indemnitees”) from and against any and all
liability, damage, loss or expense (collectively, “Losses”) to which any such Bellicum Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any
claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party to the extent such Losses arise out of: (i) the material breach by Miltenyi of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement; or (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of any Miltenyi Indemnitee (as defined below); except, in each case, to the extent that such Losses result from the material breach by
Bellicum of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any Bellicum Indemnitee. In the event Bellicum seeks indemnification under this Section
34Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
13.1, Bellicum shall (a) notify Miltenyi in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably practicable after it receives notice of the
claim, (b) provided that Miltenyi is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Miltenyi to assume direction and control of the defense
of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), provided further that Miltenyi shall act reasonably
and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to
parties being indemnified under this Section 13.1, and (c) cooperate as requested (at Miltenyi’s expense) in the defense of the claim; but
provided always that Miltenyi may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action
or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior express written permission of an authorized
representative of Bellicum.
13.2 Indemnification by Bellicum. Bellicum will save, defend and hold harmless Miltenyi, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, officers, directors,
employees, consultants and agents (collectively, “ Miltenyi Indemnitees”) from and against any and all Losses to which any such Miltenyi
Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party to the extent such
Losses arise out of: (i) the material breach by Bellicum of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this
Agreement; (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Bellicum Indemnitee (as defined above); or (iii) the development,
manufacture, use, handling, storage, sale or other disposition of any Bellicum Product by or on behalf of Bellicum; except, in each case, to
the extent such Losses result from the material breach by Miltenyi of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it
under this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Miltenyi Indemnitee. In the event Miltenyi seeks
indemnification under this Section 13.2, Miltenyi shall (a) notify Bellicum in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably
practicable after it receives notice of the claim, (b) provided that Bellicum is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Bellicum to
assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration),
provided further that Bellicum shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of
any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to parties being indemnified under this Section 13.2, and (c) cooperate as requested (at
Bellicum’s expense) in the defense of the claim; but provided always that Bellicum may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to
an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior
express written permission of Miltenyi.
13.3 Survival of Indemnification Obligations. The provisions of this Article 13 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement
for any reason whatsoever.
13.4 Insurance. Each Party will maintain at its sole cost and expense, an adequate amount of commercial general liability and product
liability insurance throughout the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, to protect against potential liabilities and risk arising
out of products supplied or activities to be performed under this Agreement and any Quality Agreement related hereto upon such terms
(including coverages, deductible limits and self-insured retentions) as are customary in the industry for the products supplied or activities
to be conducted by such Party under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, such Bellicum liability insurance or self-insurance
program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of the pre-clinical, clinical and commercial
manufacture, sale, use, distribution or marketing of Bellicum Product, and such Miltenyi liability insurance or self-insurance program will
insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of use of a Miltenyi Product in the manufacture of a Bellicum
Product. In addition, from time to time during the Term, each Party shall increase their levels of insurance coverage if reasonably deemed
prudent by such Party in light of the overall products supplied and/or activities performed under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide
the other Party with written proof of the existence of such insurance upon reasonable written request.

(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
ARTICLE 14 CONFIDENTIALITY
14.1 Definition. As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by one Party (the
“Disclosing Party ”) to the other Party (the “ Receiving Party”) pursuant to this Agreement which is (a) in written, graphic, machine
readable or other tangible form and is marked “Confidential”, “Proprietary” or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature, or
(b) oral information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of
disclosure and reduced to a written summary by the Disclosing Party, within thirty (30) calendar days after its oral disclosure, which is
marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Disclosing
Party’s failure to so mark any of its Confidential Information, whether disclosed in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible
form, or its failure to designate as confidential and reduce to writing any Confidential Information disclosed orally, shall not relieve the
Receiving Party of its obligations hereunder with respect to such Confidential Information if its confidential nature would be apparent to a
reasonable person in the biotechnology or biopharmaceutical industry, based on the subject matter of such Confidential Information or the
circumstances under which it is disclosed.
14.2 Non-Disclosure and Non-Use. During the Term and for five (5) years thereafter, each of Miltenyi and Bellicum shall keep Confidential
Information of the other Party in strict confidence and shall not (i) use the other Party’s Confidential Information for any use or purpose
except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or as otherwise authorized in writing in advance by the other
Party, or (ii) disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to anyone other than those of its Affiliates, Subcontractors, directors,
officers, employees, agents, contractors, collaborators and consultants, and in the case of Bellicum, its Licensees (collectively,
“Authorized Representatives”) who need to know such Confidential Information for a use or purpose expressly permitted under this
Agreement. Each Receiving Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of
the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Without limiting the foregoing, each Receiving Party shall take at least those
measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature (but not less than reasonable measures) and shall
ensure that any Authorized Representative of the Receiving Party who is permitted access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party pursuant to clause (ii) in the first sentence of this Section 14.2 is contractually or legally bound by obligations of non-disclosure and
non-use in scope and content at least as protective of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as the provisions hereof prior to any
disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to such Authorized Representative. The Receiving Party shall be responsible
for any breach of this Agreement by its Authorized Representatives.
14.3 Exceptions. Notwithstanding the above, a Receiving Party shall have no obligations under this Article 14 with regard to any
information of the Disclosing Party which the Receiving Party can demonstrate through competent proof: (a) was generally known and
available in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to the Receiving Party or becomes generally known and available in the public
domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party or its Authorized Representatives; (b) can be documented as previously known
by the Receiving Party prior to disclosure thereof by the Disclosing Party; (c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the
Disclosing Party; (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential
Information; or (e) becomes known to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party
without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; provided (i) only the specific information that meets the exclusions shall be
excluded, and not any other information that happens to appear in proximity to such excluded portions (for example, a portion of a
document may be excluded without affecting the confidential nature of those portions that do not themselves qualify for exclusion) or that
happens to be disclosed at the same time or in connection therewith; and (ii) specific Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be
known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party’s possession merely because of broader or related information being
known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party’s possession, nor
36Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
shall combinations of elements or principles be considered to be known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party’s
possession merely because individual elements thereof are known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party’s possession.
14.4 Permitted Disclosure.
(a) Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party
from disclosing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is legally required or compelled to do so
by any governmental investigative or judicial agency or body pursuant to proceedings over which such agency or body has jurisdiction;
provided, however, that prior to making any such required or compelled disclosure, the Receiving Party shall: (i) assert the confidential
nature of the Confidential Information to such agency or body; (ii) promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such order or
requirement to disclose; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against or limiting any such disclosure and/or
obtaining a protective order, confidential treatment and/or any other remedy narrowing the scope of the required or compelled disclosure
and protecting its confidentiality. In the event that a protective order, confidential treatment and/or other remedy is not obtained, or if the
Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement as applied to such required or compelled disclosure, then the
Receiving Party may, without liability, disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to the extent that it is legally required or
compelled to disclose. The Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information that is legally
required to disclose and will make all reasonable and diligent efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be
afforded to Confidential Information so disclosed. Disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 14.4(a) shall not alter the
character of that information as Confidential Information hereunder.
character of that information as Confidential Information hereunder.
(b) Authorized Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement (i) in
connection with the requirements of an initial public offering or securities filing; (ii) in confidence, to accountants, attorneys, other
professional advisors, banks, and financing sources and their advisors; (iii) in confidence, in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement or rights under this Agreement; or (iv) in confidence, in connection with a merger or acquisition or proposed merger or
acquisition, or a sale or proposed sale of its assets or business, or the like.
14.5 Publicity. Each Party may disclose the existence of this Agreement, but agrees that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will
be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws or regulations, neither Party
shall make any public announcement or press release regarding this Agreement or any terms thereof, or otherwise use the name, logos,
trademarks or products of the other Party in any publication, without the other Party’s express prior written consent.
14.6 Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Article 14 are necessary for the protection of the business
and goodwill of the Parties and are considered by the Parties to be reasonable for such purpose. Each Party agrees that any violation of
this Article 14 by it or its Affiliate, or Subcontractors may cause substantial and irreparable harm to the other Party and, therefore, in the
event of any violation or threatened violation of this Article 14 by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek specific
performance and other injunctive and equitable relief in addition to any other legal remedies available.
ARTICLE 15 TERM AND TERMINATION
15.1 Term. This Agreement shall enter into force on the Effective Date. The Agreement shall have an initial term of ten (10) years
commencing from the Effective Date and ending on the tenth (10th) anniversary thereof (the “ Initial Term”), unless earlier terminated by
either Party in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.2 or Section 15.3. Thereafter, Bellicum shall have consecutive separate
options to extend the Term for successive renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, a “ Renewal Term”, and
37Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
collectively with the Initial Term, the “ Term”). Provided Bellicum is not then in default with its material obligations hereunder, Bellicum
may exercise each such renewal option by giving written notice to Miltenyi not later than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the
current Term.
15.2 Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding Section 15.1 either Party may, in addition to any other remedies available to it under this
Agreement or by law, terminate this Agreement or any particular Module as follows:
(a) Termination for Material Breach. A Party may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module by providing written notice to the other
Party describing the other Party’s material breach and demanding its cure, in the event that the other Party materially breaches a material
provision of this Agreement or such Module and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice of the breach
or, if the breach is not susceptible to cure within such thirty (30) day period, if the breaching Party fails to submit to the notifying Party
and implement within such thirty (30) day period a written remedial action plan reasonably satisfactory to the notifying Party that sets out
appropriate corrective action for remedying such breach promptly after such 30-day period expires.
(b) Termination for Bankruptcy or Insolvency . A Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other
Party in the event the other Party shall have become insolvent or bankrupt, or shall have made an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, or there shall have been appointed a trustee or receiver of the other Party, or if any case or proceeding shall have been
commenced or other action taken by or against the other Party in bankruptcy or seeking reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding-
up, arrangement, composition or readjustment of its debts or any relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar
act or law of any jurisdiction now or hereinafter in effect that is not dismissed within thirty (30) days after commencement.
(c) Termination for Force Majeure . A Party may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module upon providing written notice to the
other Party if the other Party is affected by a Force Majeure event which cannot be removed, overcome or abated within three (3)
continuous months (or within such other period as the Parties jointly shall agree in writing) from the initial date of such Force Majeure
event.
15.3 Discontinuance or Suspension of Bellicum Product Program or Without Cause Termination . Bellicum may terminate this Agreement
or a particular Module upon ninety (90) days written notice to Miltenyi: 1) if Bellicum, in its sole and absolute discretion, discontinues or
indefinitely suspends the development and/or commercialization of the Bellicum Product(s) or 2) without cause for any reason or no
reason. Upon the termination of this Agreement or such Module pursuant to this Section 15.3, Bellicum’s sole obligation shall be for it to
make payment of all undisputed and properly due amounts payable for Miltenyi Product ordered prior to the effective date of such
termination of each terminated Module, including any Purchase Order to be made by Bellicum in connection with Bellicum’s then-
outstanding obligation to purchase quantities of Miltenyi Product forecasted with respect to an applicable Firm Zone. For clarity,
termination of this Agreement or any Module pursuant to this Section 15.3 shall not release Bellicum from its payment obligations with
respect to the quantities set forth in any Purchase Orders or quantities forecasted for any Firm Zone.
15.4 Expiration or termination of this Agreement or a particular Module for any reason shall not release either Party from liability accrued
under this Agreement or such Module, respectively, prior to such expiration or termination, nor preclude either Party from pursuing any
rights or remedies accrued prior to such expiration or termination or accrued at law or in equity with respect to any uncured material
breach of this Agreement or such Module.
15.5 The termination of this Agreement or a particular Module shall not operate to relieve Bellicum from its obligation to pay undisputed
and properly due amounts of (a) the Product Price of all
38Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
quantities of Miltenyi Products (i) delivered in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable Quality Agreement up
to the effective date of termination and (ii) to be delivered under outstanding Purchase Orders accepted by Miltenyi prior to the date of
notice of termination (including the Ordered Quantities) or (iii) forecasted for any Firm Zone in the most recent applicable Monthly
Forecast; (b) any Upfront Fee payable under Section 8.1 and any earned Milestone Fee payable under Section 8.2 hereof; and (c) all other
undisputed and properly due fees and/or expenses owed to Miltenyi in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable
Quality Agreement prior to the date of notice of termination; provided, however, that in the event of termination of this Agreement or such
Module(s) by Bellicum pursuant to Section 15.2 (Termination for Cause), Bellicum shall not be responsible for payments relating to any
portion of the Forecast applicable to any period after the effective date of termination. All amounts paid under Sections 8.1 through 8.3
shall be non-refundable once paid.
15.6 Post Termination. Upon the termination or expiry of this Agreement, each Party shall promptly return to the other Party or destroy, at
the other Party's request,
(a) any and all Confidential Information of the other Party then in its possession or control, except if such information is covered under
surviving license rights, and further provided that each Party may keep one (1) copy of such information in its legal archives for
regulatory compliance purposes and in order to determine its ongoing obligations hereunder, including in connection with legal
proceedings; and such additional copies of or any computer records or files containing such Confidential Information that have been
created solely by the Receiving Party’s automatic archiving and back-up procedures, to the extent created and retained in a manner
consistent with the Receiving Party’s standard archiving and back-up procedures, but not for any other use or purpose; and
(b) any and all remaining materials and capital equipment of the other Party then in its possession or control.
15.7 Survival. Other than obligations which have accrued and are outstanding as of the date of any expiration or termination of this
Agreement, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Quality Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed by
the Parties in writing, all rights granted and obligations undertaken by the Parties hereunder shall terminate immediately upon the
termination or expiration of this Agreement, subject to Section 15.4 above and except for the following which shall survive according to
their terms: Section 2.2 (Permitted Use); Section 2.7 (Subcontracting by Bellicum); Article 10 (Intellectual Property); Article 11
(Warranty); Article 12 (Limitation of Liability); Article 13 (Indemnification; Insurance); Article 14 (Confidentiality and Non-disclosure);
Section 15.7 (Post-termination); Section 15.7 (Survival); Article 16 (Notices); Article 17 (Assignment); Article 19 (Dispute Resolution and
Applicable Law); and Article 20 (Miscellaneous); and any and all rights and obligations of the Parties thereunder, as well as any other

ARTICLE 17 ASSIGNMENT
17.1 This Agreement shall not be assignable, pledged or otherwise transferred, nor may any right or obligations hereunder be assigned,
pledged or transferred, by either Party to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent, in the event
of a financing transaction by the Party asking for consent, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by the other Party;
except either Party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement without the consent of the other Party to an entity that acquires all or
substantially all of the business or assets of the assigning Party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by merger,
acquisition or otherwise; provided that intellectual property rights that are owned or held by the acquiring entity or person to such
transaction (if other than one of the Parties to this Agreement) shall not be included in the technology licensed hereunder. In addition,
either Party shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement to an Affiliate upon written notice to the non-assigning
Party; provided, however, the assigning or transferring Party shall continue to remain liable
40Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
for the performance of this Agreement by such Affiliate. Upon any such assignment, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
binding upon, or inuring to the benefit of, the assigning Party shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, its assignee, whether so
expressed in the assignment or not. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit Miltenyi or any of its Affiliates from granting a security
interest in this Agreement and any rights hereunder to any Third Party in connection with any financing transaction to the extent provided
under (and subject to the restrictions on the rights of secured parties contained in) Applicable Laws. In addition, Miltenyi or any Affiliate
of Miltenyi shall have the right to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any accounts and payment intangibles in connection with any
financing transaction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of each Party, its successors and permitted
assigns. Any assignment of this Agreement in contravention of this Article 17 shall be null and void.
ARTICLE 18 FORCE MAJEURE
18.1 Neither Party will be liable to the other Party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or
any part of this Agreement if such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the reasonable
control and without negligence of the Parties (“ Force Majeure Event ”). Such events, occurrences, or causes will include acts of God,
strikes, lockouts, acts of war, riots, civil commotion, terrorist acts, epidemic, failure or default of public utilities or common carriers,
destruction of facilities or materials by fire, explosion, earthquake, storm or the like catastrophe, and failure of plant or machinery
(provided that such failure could not have been prevented by the exercise of skill, diligence and prudence that would be reasonably and
ordinarily expected from a skilled and experienced person engaged in the same type of undertaking under the same or similar
circumstances), but the inability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.
18.2 The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall inform promptly the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event’s
occurrence, anticipated duration and cessation. The Party giving such notice shall thereupon be excused from such of its obligations
hereunder as it is thereby disabled from performing for so long as it is so disabled, provided, however, that such affected Party
commences and continues to take reasonable and diligent actions to cure such cause.
ARTICLE 19 APPLICABLE LAWS; JURISDICTION
19.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York, USA, without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods; provided, however, that any dispute relating to the scope, validity, enforceability or infringement of any
Intellectual Property Right will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the jurisdiction in
which such Intellectual Property Right applies.
19.2 Dispute Resolution Procedures . Should any dispute, claim or controversy arise between the Parties relating to the validity,
interpretation, existence, performance, termination or breach of this Agreement (collectively, a “ Dispute”), the Parties shall use their best
efforts to resolve the Dispute by good faith negotiations, first between their respective representatives directly involved in that Dispute and
the Alliance Managers for a period of thirty (30) days, and then, if necessary, between vice presidents of the Parties for an additional
fifteen (15) days, and then, if necessary, between Chief Executive Officers of the Parties for an additional five (5) Business Days. Any
such Dispute not satisfactorily settled by negotiation in accordance with the foregoing process, either Party may submit such Dispute to a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with subsection (a) below; provided that nothing in this Section 19.2 will preclude either
Party from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section (a) below.
(a) Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue. Each Party hereto agrees that any action, proceeding or claim it commences against the
other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be brought
41Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum
Supply Agreement
(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)
in the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment. Each Party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the State of New York Courts and irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court
does not have jurisdiction over such Party. Each Party agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding in
such a court shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Applicable Law.
(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. Due to the high costs and time involved in commercial litigation before a jury, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE
ALL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL ISSUES IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.
19.3 Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges that its breach of its obligations under this Agreement may result in immediate and
irreparable harm to the other Party, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach, the non-breaching Party may, in addition to other remedies, immediately seek from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive

existing sources are curtailed or are inadequate to meet Seller's own requirements and/or its obligations to its customers, Seller's obligation to
deliver Product during such period shall be reduced to the extent necessary, in Seller's sole judgment, to apportion fairly among Seller's own

CUTANEA will as soon as practicable and, in any event within another two (2) Business Days thereafter provide such written notice to Supplier
and be responsible for any storage or similar charges that Supplier may incur for not delivering such Product. The lack of reception of such written
acceptance within the second two (2) Business Day period shall be deemed as the batch is accepted. If, once the Product is delivered, CUTANEA

2.10.1 Supplier will promptly notify CUTANEA in writing in the event that Supplier is unable or anticipates that it will be unable to supply
compliant Products in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement (each a “Failure to Supply”). Supplier undertakes to implement
appropriate methods to ensure consistency of supply of the Product for the Territory throughout the Term of the Agreement, including but not
limited to using its commercially reasonable efforts to qualify an alternative site owned or operated by Supplier or its Affiliates to Manufacture the
Product and obtain approval thereof from the FDA and, if necessary the possible qualification of alternate sources of supply by
Supplier. CUTANEA shall be entitled to propose to Supplier such alternate sources of supply if Supplier has not taken any steps to qualify such
alternate supplier before the Failure to Supply, and Supplier shall evaluate in good faith the proposal from CUTANEA. Should the Parties agree to
such qualification as a remedy to a Failure to Supply, then Supplier will grant any necessary licenses and conducting technology transfer as
reasonably necessary to enable such alternate supplier to Manufacture the Product during Supplier’s Failure to Supply.
2.10.2 If Supplier fails to supply all or part of any shipment of Products ordered by CUTANEA on the delivery date specified on the
applicable purchase order for such shipment, in addition to any other remedies the CUTANEA may have, CUTANEA at its sole discretion, may
require Supplier to supply the undelivered Products at a future date agreed upon by CUTANEA and Supplier, but nonetheless such Products shall
count toward any binding purchase obligation of CUTANEA, whether as part of the Forecast or otherwise.

to CUTANEA upon [***]. [***].

Capitalized terms in this Exhibit A are defined in LSA.
The initial purchase price for trade units of the Products shall be set at $[***] per [***] sample tube of the Product, $[***] per [***] trade unit of
the Product, $[***] per [***] trade unit of the Product, and $[***] per [***] trade unit of the Product, FCA manufacturing site (the “Supply Unit
Price”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, after December 31, 2018 and during the term of this Agreement, Ferrer may change its Supply Unit Price on
any or all the Products from time to time, but no more than once annually, based on documented actual increases to Ferrer’s direct manufacturing
and labor (but specifically excluding overhead) costs (or those charged by its nominee), provided that Ferrer furnishes the Company with at least
thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such change. The increase shall apply to any order received by Ferrer after the communication date of
the increase. In the event that the new Supply Unit Price for the Products may make the business not feasible, the Parties, in good faith and through
the Joint Steering Committee, agree to meet and negotiate in good faith an alternative solution.
The purchase price for the Products shall be paid in US Dollars by the Company and such payment terms shall be [***] following the date that the
Products are received and accepted (as per Article 4.4 of the LSA) by the Company, by wire transfer into an account designated by Ferrer. Invoices
shall be generated upon shipment of Product from Supplier. Invoices should be sent by email to the following address: invoice@cutanea.com .
Failure to send invoices to the email address provided herein may cause a delay in approval and payment. In the event that the Company does not
fulfill such terms, Parties agree to discuss in good faith alternative payment conditions. In case there is not an agreement between the Parties after
30 days, Ferrer will accept an irrevocable and guaranteed letter of credit payable as term of payment.
Additionally, Parties agree to share exchange EUR/ USD rate fluctuations covering the payment of royalties. More concretely, within the first 30
days after every calendar year, Ferrer will calculate the average annual EUR/USD rate based on the EUR/USD rates published in the Financial Times
the last business day of every month. Such EUR/USD average rate will be compared with the rate applied in every invoice during the year. If, as a
result of this reconciliation, there arises a difference above or under [***]%, Parties agree to share the resulting amount on an equitable basis
(50%). Ferrer will report the reconciliation to the Company for its acceptance and, after 15 business days, issue an invoice which will be
debited/credited in the next 30 days by wire transfer into the accounts designated by the Parties.

MASTER SUPPLY AGREEMENT
THIS MASTER SUPPLY AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made as of 31 October 2019 (“Effective Date”) by and between Premier Nutrition
Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with its headquarters located at 1222 67 th Street, Suite 210, Emeryville, CA 94608 (“Buyer” or
“PNC”), and Fonterra (USA) Inc., a California corporation with its principal place of business located at 8700 W. Bryn Mawr Avenue, Suite 500N,
Chicago, IL 60631 (“Supplier” or “Fonterra”) (each a “Party”, collectively “Parties”).
WHEREAS PNC produces, distributes, markets and sells products including ready to drink protein shakes and beverages, powdered protein
shakes, nutrition bars, and dietary supplements (the “Finished Products”); and
WHEREAS Supplier produces raw materials including protein powders used by PNC to produce at least some of the Finished Products;
NOW THEREFORE in consideration of their respective rights and obligations as set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which are acknowledged, PNC and Supplier agree as follows:
1 Supply of Ingredients
1.1 Supplier will provide such materials to PNC or its Third Party Manufacturers (“TPMs”) as are specified in any Master Purchase
Commitment or any other purchase orders that the Parties may execute from time to time during the term of this Agreement
(“Ingredients”). Ingredients will be produced at Supplier’s facilities listed in a Master Purchase Commitment, or any other of
Supplier’s facilities approved in advance, in writing by PNC.
1.2 PNC or its TPMs will place specific orders for Ingredients from Supplier by issuing a purchase order that specifies, at minimum,
the item, quantities, price, delivery dates, and delivery and payment terms (each a “Purchase Order”).
1.3 PNC and Supplier may enter certain Master Purchase Commitments from time to time during the Term of this Master Supply
Agreement. Such Master Purchase Commitments and any Purchase Orders issued against such Commitments shall be subject
exclusively to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event the terms of any Master Purchase Commitment conflicts
with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Master Purchase Commitment shall control.
1.4 Supplier will receive Purchase Orders by telephone, USPS, overnight courier, email, and fax transmission, Monday through Friday
except on state or nationally recognized bank holidays. Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to
be received on the following
Page 1business day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within
such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier. Each Purchase Order issued by PNC or its TPMs and accepted by Supplier shall be
governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Additional terms included in acknowledgments, standard terms and conditions, or any
other documents or communications exchanged by the Parties in connection with the sale or purchase of any Ingredients shall be void and of no
force or effect. The Parties may only modify, add to or amend any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by a writing signed by authorized
representatives of both Parties.
1.5 Supplier represents and warrants that at the time and date of delivery, the Ingredients will comply with all specifications
(“Specifications”), a copy of which will be attached to the relevant Master Purchase Commitment or Purchase Order accordingly.
A Specification may be updated from time to time by PNC in its sole discretion, provided PNC provides Supplier with reasonable
prior notice on any updates (“Change Notification”). Within [***] from receipt of the Change Notification, Supplier will either: (1)
accept the Specification change at the current price and terms; or (2) submit to PNC a proposal (“Proposal”) setting forth the
conditions of acceptance that may include a change in price and/or other terms, including documentation to support same.
Within [***] the Parties will discuss the Proposal in good faith and exercise their best efforts to agree on the appropriate
adjustment if any. PNC will not issue any Purchase Orders, nor be required to issue any Purchase Orders to Supplier until PNC
and Supplier have agreed on required Ingredient Specifications and any associated price and/or term adjustment. In the event the
Parties fail to agree on required Ingredient Specifications or price and/or term adjustments despite their best good faith efforts,
neither Party will have any further obligation with regard to purchase or supply of those Ingredients under any Master Purchase
Commitments except that PNC shall take and pay for [***] of Ingredient inventory manufactured according to the then-current
Specification.
1.6 Supplier will provide a Certificate of Analysis (“COA”) completed in accordance with the Specifications with any shipment of
Ingredients.
1.7 INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
1.8 This Agreement is nonexclusive and sets forth the terms and conditions under which the Parties will supply and purchase
Ingredients from the other Party. Nothing herein is intended to, nor does, guarantee that either Party will supply or purchase any
specific, item, in any specific quantity, or conclude any business transaction with the other.
1.9 Supplier Performance metrics will be identified and tracked periodically through Supplier Performance Review meetings no more
frequently than each calendar quarter during the Term. [***] Metric targets will be established by PNC and agreed by Fonterra
and updated as needed. The ultimate goal is zero defects for quality and administrative compliance issues.
1.10 Supplier agrees to make a good faith effort to provide Advance Ship Notices (“ASN”) with bar-coded pallet labels; Invoices,
Purchase Orders and other business transactions, as may be advised by PNC, for each Ingredient shipment. Supplier will provide,
itself or through a third-party provider, the information via Electronic Data Interface (“EDI”) if and as requested by PNC. The
technical specifications for all required EDI transactions will be provided by PNC.
22 Quality and Food Safety
2.1 For the purposes set forth in Section 303(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “Act”), Supplier guarantees to PNC
that as of the time and date of delivery, all Ingredients will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the Act, nor
will any Ingredients constitute an article that may not, under the provisions of Sections 404 and 505 of the Act, be introduced
into interstate commerce. The Supplier further guarantees that as of the time and date of delivery, all of the Ingredients will be in
compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, requirements and programs including those administered by the Food and Drug
Administration (the “FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) and any state or local food or drug laws
then in effect. This guarantee specifically includes Proposition 65 (California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act),
and Supplier hereby certifies that the Ingredients will not contain any non-naturally occurring chemicals subject to Proposition 65
or that any such chemicals pose “no significant risk” or cause “no observable effect” as set forth in the California Health and
Safety Code, 22 CCR §§ 12701 et seq . and 22 CCR §§ 12801 et seq ., as amended. Supplier shall comply with all applicable
regulatory requirements for determining and documenting that all Ingredients are at or below no significant risk levels and no
observable effect levels, as applicable.
2.2 Supplier shall develop and maintain a food safety/food defense program as required under the Food Safety Modernization Act 21
USC §301 et seq  and shall submit a copy of such plan (and any changes thereto) to PNC upon PNC’s request. Supplier will
conduct [***] third-party food safety/food defense audits (the “Audits”) in compliance with, and consistent with, relevant audit
schemes approved by the Global Food Safety Initiatives, AIB International, Silliker, or GMA SAFE. Supplier will submit
summaries of audit reports to PNC’s Quality Manager at [***] upon request. Failure to comply with the requirements of this
Section 2.2 will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
2.3 Supplier will notify PNC immediately, by person-to-person voice communication or equivalent means, if any of the Ingredients
contain, or are reasonably suspected to contain, material hazardous to human health, including but not limited to, chemical,
physical or biological hazards.
2.4 PNC shall notify Supplier in writing if it determines any Ingredient fails to meet the Specifications. Supplier shall be given an
opportunity to and will promptly inspect and/or test such Ingredients to confirm compliance to Specification. If after any
reasonable, good faith inspection and testing it is confirmed that certain Ingredients fail to meet the Specifications [***].
2.5 Subject to the occurring of a Force Majeure Event, if Supplier fails to deliver the Ingredients in accordance with the
Specifications, including within the time specified on the Purchase Order, in addition to any other remedies available, PNC may
terminate the Purchase Order in whole or in part. In the event of such a termination, Supplier shall continue performance of any
nonterminated portion of the Purchase Order, or any nonterminated Purchase Orders, and the quantity of Ingredient ordered and
so terminated shall be deducted against any relevant Master Purchase Commitment.
2.6 PNC or its contracted third-party auditors may enter and audit/inspect Supplier’s facilities where the Ingredients are produced,
stored, packaged or otherwise processed [***] unless food safety is at issue or PNC has a good faith reason to believe the
Ingredients are being stored, packaged, or processed
3in a way that is inconsistent with the Specifications, in which case an audit may be performed at any time during the Term. For routine visits and
audits, PNC will provide [***] if facilities located in the US and with [***] if facilities are located [***], provided that such examination will be
conducted during Supplier’s normal business hours and in such a manner as to reasonably minimize disruption to Supplier’s business, unless food
safety is at issue, in which case such examination may be conducted at any time. Supplier shall cooperate in good faith with PNC during all such
inspections. During qualification processes and on-site inspections, Supplier will present necessary documentation to ensure compliance with all
applicable programs specified under 21 CFR Part 117 Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventative Controls
for Human Food. Records of environmental monitoring activities by the Supplier, following Supplier’s established environmental monitoring
program and standard operating procedures will be made available upon request to PNC. Supplier will notify Buyer immediately via person-to-
person voice communication in the event that any pathogen is found, or reasonably suspected, in the plant environment during any environmental
monitoring activity that could have an impact on the quality or safety of PNC’s Ingredients. In the event of an actual or suspected food safety
concern, Supplier shall conduct sampling in all relevant areas and promptly provide results of such tests to PNC. If PNC or its representatives find
that any of Supplier’s facilities, processes, inventory, procedures or equipment are not in accordance or compliance with the requirements of this
Agreement or applicable law or regulation, PNC will give notice to Supplier, and Supplier shall promptly take all reasonable steps to correct such
deficiency as soon as possible. If correction of the deficiency cannot be affected within [***] of such notice, then Supplier shall promptly notify
PNC with its plan to correct the deficiency including an estimated schedule. If the deficiency cannot be corrected within [***], unless otherwise
agreed, then PNC shall have the right to terminate any Purchase Orders then outstanding, along with any Master Purchase Commitment related
thereto.
3 Business Continuity/Continuous Supply Assurances . Supplier will develop and maintain a business continuity plan that identifies critical
pathways and potential crisis situations that could interrupt the supply of Ingredients to PNC and establish contingency plans for dealing
with each crisis situation. Upon PNC’s written request, Supplier will submit the business continuity plan to PNC for PNC’s review.

such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to
purchase or sell such securities.
5.7 Title. As between the Parties, title or right to possess Confidential Information of PNC, except as otherwise provided herein, shall
remain in PNC. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights to any Confidential

actions as are necessary (including validation and if necessary adapting or reserving existing facilities, establishing new facilities and/or procuring
necessary equipment) to Manufacture Extract meeting SutroVax’ requirements for Phase 3 and commercial supply in such quantities as SutroVax
designates. It is understood that SutroVax may request that the Process Transfer and establishment of Capacity be undertaken in separate steps, for
example by undertaking an initial Process Transfer to demonstrate the CMO’s ability to Manufacture Extract, and then later establishing Capacity for
Phase 3 and commercial supply, as requested by SutroVax in accordance with Section 2.15.1(a) (i.e., in separate requests).
(c) Selection of Alternate Supplier . The “Alternate Supplier” will be selected by Sutro, provided that Sutro must select an “Alternate Supplier” that is
substantially similar to those CMOs identified on Schedule 2.15.1 hereto and provided further that SutroVax shall have the right to veto such selection
based only on a genuine and material conflict of interest between SutroVax and the Alternate Supplier. Additional CMOs may be added to Schedule 2.15.1
by Sutro with SutroVax’s approval (not to be withheld unreasonably).(d) Alternate Supplier as Subcontractor . It is understood that the Alternate Supplier established under the Transfer Addendum shall operate as a
subcontractor of Sutro under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement, and as such SutroVax will order from Sutro
thereunder any Extract to be Manufactured by such Alternate Supplier. Subject to the foregoing, the Transfer Addendum and the Phase 3/Commercial
Supply Agreement will include reasonable and customary rights for SutroVax to conduct audits/inspections, site visits, quarterly meetings, each such
audit/inspection, site visit and quarterly meeting to be coordinated by Sutro and to occur in the presence of a representative for Sutro and SutroVax, in
connection with the Alternate Supplier’s manufacture of Extract for supply to SutroVax. For clarity, SutroVax shall not conduct any business discussions
for the supply of Extract with the Alternate Supplier in a manner that induces the Alternate Supplier to breach its agreement with Sutro. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Sutro undergoes a Change of Control or Sutro permits any third party to acquire Extract directly from an Alternate Supplier
established under the Transfer Addendum, then SutroVax shall thereafter have the right to establish a supply agreement with and obtain supply of Extract
directly from such Alternate Supplier.
(e) Quotations . Upon SutroVax’s request (which request, for clarity, may be before a request to negotiate a Transfer Addendum), Sutro shall seek
quotations from one or more Third Party CMO(s) for such a Process Transfer and/or establishment of such Capacity, in each case as requested by
SutroVax, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to establish requests for quotations for such purposes.
(f) Arbitration . If the Parties have not agreed upon a Transfer Addendum within [***] after SutroVax’ request, upon SutroVax’ request by written notice to
Sutro, the terms and conditions of the Transfer Addendum shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 11.4. For clarity, however, it is understood that a Transfer Addendum shall not include any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or
Sublicens.ee s any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How.
2.15.2 Source of Supply . It is understood that after the Alternate Supplier is qualified, SutroVax shall have the right under this Supply Agreement and the
Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement to specify whether Extract ordered from Sutro pursuant to this Agreement or the Phase 3/Commercial Supply
Agreement will be Manufactured at Sutro’s Facility or at the Alternate Supplier’s facilities (and to the extent Extract from the Alternate Supplier is ordered
under this Supply Agreement or the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement, the facility of the Alternate Supplier shall be deemed a Facility for purposes
of this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the FDA and EMA have
confirmed that Extract manufactured at Sutro’s Facility and the Alternate Supplier’s Facility are interchangeable and can be supplied from either such
Facility without any additional regulatory requirements or regulatory delay with respect to the applicable Vaccine Composition, and such Extract
otherwise meets SutroVax’ requirements, then with SutroVax’ consent (not to be withheld unreasonably) Sutro may supply Extract from either Sutro’s
Facility or the Alternate Supplier’s Facility.
2.15.3 Price. To the extent Sutro or its Affiliate Manufactures Extract supplied to SutroVax, the Price (per unit volume or unit weight) under this Supply
Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement for such Extract shall not exceed [***] of the Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs of such
Extract; and to the extent the Extract to be supplied to SutroVax is Manufactured by a Third Party (including the Alternate Supplier), the Price to becharged to SutroVax under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement for such Extract shall equal the amount Sutro paid
such Third Party for such Extract (“ OOP Cost”) plus an amount reasonably calculated to cover Sutro’s FTE costs to procure and manage the relationship
with such Third Party, such amount not to exceed [***] of the OOP Cost for such Extract. To the extent that Sutro or its Affiliate receives any portion of
the amounts paid to such Third Party to Manufacture Extract (e.g., as a profit share or otherwise), the Price to be charged SutroVax shall be the lesser of i)
[***], or ii) [***]; in either case, [***]. For clarity, Section 3.4 of the License Agreement shall apply with respect to the Alternate Supplier.
2.15.4 Sutro/Third Party use of Alternate Supplier . Once the Alternate Supplier is qualified pursuant to this Section 2.15, SutroVax shall have the first right
(as between SutroVax and Sutro or Third Parties supplied or authorized by Sutro) to obtain Extract Manufactured by the Alternate Supplier up to the
Capacity established pursuant to the Transfer Addendum for a period ending the later of [***] or [***], and provided SutroVax commits to [***] or [***].
2.16 Other Extracts. From time-to-time, subject to an agreed-upon Work Order, SutroVax may place purchase orders for quantities of research grade
extract derived from strains of E. Coli other than that set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto (each an “ Other Extract”). Sutro shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to accept such purchase orders (and shall accept such purchase orders placed consistent with an agreed-upon Work Order) and
manufacture and supply to SutroVax such Other Extracts. For the purpose of calculating the Price for Other Extracts in accordance with this Section, the
Price will be the cost of materials and Sutro’s labor at an FTE rate of [***] per year for Sutro laboratory scientists. Upon Sutro’s acceptance of a purchase
order for Other Extract, such Other Extract in such purchase order shall be deemed Extract for purposes of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4.1 (solely with respect
to the last two sentences thereof), 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9.1 , 3.1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9.
2.17 Manufacture of Custom Reagents. For clarity, SutroVax may Manufacture Custom Reagents itself or obtain supply thereof through a Third Party
independent of this Supply Agreement and nothing in this Supply Agreement is intended to restrict SutroVax from doing so. Upon SutroVax’s request,
and subject to the remainder of the terms of this Section 2.17, Sutro shall (a) transfer to SutroVax or a contract manufacturer designated by SutroVax
(which contract manufacturer is reasonably acceptable to Sutro, the approval of which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditions or delayed by
Sutro) as soon as reasonably practicable the process to Manufacture each Custom Reagent and the items of Sutro Know-How reasonably necessary for
SutroVax or its designee to Manufacture each Custom Reagent, including cell lines, standard operating procedures, protocols, batch records, analytical
method standard operating procedures and analytical method transfer protocols and (b) make Sutro Personnel reasonably available to SutroVax or its
designee for scientific and technical explanations and on-site  support that may reasonably be requested by SutroVax or its designee to Manufacture the
Custom Reagents; provided however, that SutroVax shall fully reimburse Sutro for all documented time spent by Sutro’s personnel to perform such
transfer (on an FTE basis, each such FTE charged at an annual rate of [***]) and out-of-pocket  costs incurred by Sutro in connection with all of the
activities under the preceding sub-clauses  (a) and (b), in accordance with a budget reasonably approved in advance by SutroVax. Upon such SutroVax
request, Sutro and SutroVax shall, within [***] days, agree on a scope of work for such transfer, includingscale, timeline, estimated budget, and required materials; both parties shall use reasonable efforts to complete the transfer as soon as reasonably
practical. If requested by SutroVax (including if such request is prior to agreement on a scope of work), Sutro shall promptly transfer to SutroVax or its
designee the cell lines, manufacturing instructions and analytical methods used for Manufacture of each Custom Reagent. For clarity, SutroVax shall have
the right to enter into an agreement directly with such designee for the Manufacture and supply of Custom Reagents directly to SutroVax, its Affiliates,
and any SutroVax CMO and, upon SutroVax’s request, to the extent necessary, Sutro shall authorize such designee to enter into such agreement with
SutroVax and perform such activities. For further clarity, Sutro shall not be responsible for any damages resulting from delay or failure in establishing the
processes for Manufacture of Custom Reagents at SutroVax’s designee resulting from action or inaction on the part of the designee or to the extent
beyond Sutro’s control. SutroVax shall have the right to obtain from such designee such items of Sutro Know-How transferred to such designee and use
such items in connection with the exercise of its rights pursuant to the License Agreement, including for the Manufacture of Custom Reagents and the
management of such designee. SutroVax shall use such Sutro Know-How transferred under this Section 2.17 (to the extent it is Discloser’s Information of
Sutro and does not meet one or more the criteria in clause (a) through (e) of Section 10.1 of the License Agreement) only for the Manufacture of Custom
Reagents or otherwise within the scope of rights and licenses granted SutroVax in the License Agreement. In case of such a transfer to SutroVax or its
designee, SutroVax will share with Sutro (i) the proposed process for manufacture of Custom Reagents through a Third Party so that Sutro may provide
feedback and ensure that the process and Specifications are consistent with Sutro’s process, and (ii) all regulatory submissions (including DMFs with
respect to Custom Reagents) at least [***] days in advance of their intended date of submission to a Regulatory Authority in the Territory, and shall take
into account Sutro’s feedback to ensure alignment with Sutro’s regulatory submissions and Regulatory Approvals with respect to Custom Reagents.
Following completion of the transfer set forth above, Sutro shall provide reasonable support for the use of Third Party Custom Reagents in conjunction
with Extract supplied by or on behalf of Sutro. In addition, Extract supplied by Sutro that conforms to the Required Standards when tested with Custom
Reagents supplied by Sutro but not with Custom Reagents manufactured under this Section shall be deemed to conform to the Required Standards and
SutroVax may not reject such Extract as a result of such non-conformance  to the Required Standards when tested with Custom Reagents. SutroVax shall
not prevent Sutro from separately contracting with the contract manufacturer for Manufacture of Custom Reagents for use on its own behalf or on behalf
of other third parties.
2.18 Sutro Core Know-How. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except as set forth in Section 15.3 of the License Agreement, in no event shall
SutroVax, its Affiliates or Sublicensees have the right to access any Sutro Core Know-How (as defined in the License Agreement), whether directly from
Sutro or its Affiliates or through a CMO or otherwise, and SutroVax, its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall not require, request or solicit any CMO to deliver
any Sutro Core Know-How to SutroVax, its Affiliates and/or its Sublicensees, and no agreement between any CMO and Sutro, its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries shall contain any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicensees any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any item of Sutro Core Know-How is delivered to SutroVax, its Affiliates and/or its Sublicensees (except as set
forth in Section 15.3 of the License Agreement), SutroVax, its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall immediately return such item to Sutro. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent SutroVax or any of its Affiliatesor Sublicensees is required by a Regulatory Authority (or Applicable Law) in the United States, Europe or Japan to confidentially disclose, as part of the
applicable regulatory filings with respect to a Vaccine Composition, any Sutro Core Know-How (for clarity, excluding any tangible embodiments of such
Sutro Core Know-How other than information and documentation), Sutro shall, upon SutroVax’s written request, confidentially disclose such Sutro Core
Know-How as part of the applicable regulatory filings, subject to the payment obligations set forth in Section 5.4 of the License Agreement.
2.19 Express Rights. Except as expressly set forth in this Supply Agreement, no rights or licenses are granted to SutroVax under this Supply Agreement.
2.20 Extract Requirements. SutroVax agrees to purchase all its requirements of Extract from Sutro in accordance with this Agreement, except to the extent
SutroVax is allowed to purchase Extract from (a) Alternate Suppliers engaged by Sutro in accordance with Section 2.15 of this Agreement; (b) a CMO
engaged or established and authorized by Sutro under Section 3.l(d) of the License Agreement; or (c) a CMO authorized by Sutro under Section 3.l(e) of
the License Agreement. Manufacturing of Extracts in breach of this Section 2.20 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and the License
Agreement by SutroVax.
ARTICLE 3
PRICING AND PAYMENT
3.1 Invoices. Sutro shall invoice SutroVax at the time of each shipment of Product(s) for the Price for such shipment. SutroVax will pay such invoices
within [***] days of receipt of invoice (including all required documentation) by SutroVax.

Sutro’s calculation of the Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs) or payments and Sutro’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Supply
Agreement. Audits and inspections may be conducted by SutroVax’s own personnel or retained consultant(s), subject to the confidentiality obligations
set forth in this Supply Agreement.
3.4 Taxes. The Prices are exclusive of all Taxes. SutroVax will pay all taxes and duties that are assessed by any national, federal, state or local
governmental authority on SutroVax’s purchase or use of the Products, including, without limitation, sales, use, excise, value-added and withholding
taxes, but excluding any taxes based on Sutro’s income or gross receipts (collectively, “ Taxes”). Sutro will separately identify all such Taxes on Sutro’s
invoice.ARTICLE 4
PRODUCT TESTING
4.1 Product Testing and Inspections. Each shipment of Product shall be accompanied by a certificate of analysis describing all current requirements of
the Specifications and results of tests performed on such Product and a certificate of conformity certifying that the quantities of Product supplied have
been Manufactured, controlled and released according to the Required Standards (“ COA/COC”) as set forth in the applicable Quality Agreement
(subject to SutroVax’s conduct of the SutroVax Activity Test to confirm Extract meets the SutroVax Activity Criteria). The COA/COC acceptance criteria for
each Product shall be set forth in the Specification for such Product. Two of the tests and corresponding COA/COC acceptance criteria for the Extract
shall be the performance of a productivity (Activity) test of the applicable Sutro protein (the “ Sutro Activity Test” and “Sutro Activity Criteria”) and the
performance of a productivity (activity) test of the applicable Vaccine Composition (the “ SutroVax Activity Test” and “SutroVax Activity Criteria”).
Sutro shall perform the Sutro Activity Test to confirm that all shipments of Extract meet the Sutro Activity Criteria and SutroVax (or its designee) shall
perform the SutroVax Activity Test to confirm that all shipments of Extract meet the SutroVax Activity Criteria. Sutro will also provide SutroVax with
Material Safety Data Sheets (“ MSDS”) or an equivalent instrument recognized by the applicable Regulatory Authority as required for the Product(s), and
updates of the same as necessary.
4.2 Acceptance/Rejection of Non-Conforming Goods. SutroVax or its designee shall have a period of [***] calendar days from the date of delivery of the
Product(s) in accordance with Section 2.6 and the COA/COCs or the equivalent instrument recognized by the applicable Regulatory Authority for such
Product(s) (“Acceptance Period”), to inspect any shipment of Product(s) and conduct the SutroVax Activity Test to determine whether such shipment
conforms to the Required Standards. If SutroVax determines that the Product(s) do not conform to the Required Standards, it hall notify Sutro within the
Acceptance Period, and, if requested by Sutro, SutroVax shall ship a sample of such non-conforming Product(s) to Sutro at Sutro’s expense. SutroVax’s
failure to notify Sutro of the non-conformity within the Acceptance Period will be deemed for purposes of this Supply Agreement to constitute SutroVax’s
acceptance of such shipment, provided, however, that such acceptance shall be subject to SutroVax’s right to reject Product(s) until [***] days from the
delivery date of the applicable Product, in each case, due to discovery by SutroVax or SutroVax’s Affiliates or designees that the applicable Product does
not conform to the Required Standards and such non-conformance  could not reasonably be discovered within the Acceptance Period (“ Latent Defects”)
provided that SutroVax gives Sutro with written notice of such Latent Defect within [***] days of SutroVax or any SutroVax Affiliate or designee
becoming aware of such defect.
4.3 Disputes Regarding Conformance to Required Standards. If Sutro does not agree with SutroVax’s determination that Product fails to conform to the
Required Standards, then Sutro shall so notify SutroVax in writing within [***] days of its receipt of SutroVax’s notice of non-conformity with respect to
such Product and (if requested) Product sample. Sutro and SutroVax shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such disagreement as promptly as possible.Without limiting the foregoing, Sutro and SutroVax shall discuss in good faith mutually acceptable testing procedures pursuant to which both Sutro and
SutroVax will re-test a sample of the disputed Product to determine whether such Product meets the Required Standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that Sutro and SutroVax are unable to resolve such disagreement within [***] days of the date of the applicable rejection notice, either Party
may submit a sample of the allegedly non-conforming Product for testing and a determination as to whether or not such Product conforms to the
Required Standards to an independent testing organization, or to a consultant of recognized repute within the United States pharmaceutical industry, in
either case mutually agreed upon by the Parties (such organization or consultant, the “ Laboratory”), the appointment of which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed by either Party. The determination of the Laboratory with respect to all or part of any shipment of Product shall be final and binding
upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Laboratory making such determination shall be borne by Sutro, in the event that the Laboratory
determines that the Product was non-conforming and by SutroVax, in the event that the Laboratory determines that the Product did conform to the
Required Standards.
4.4 Return and Replacement of Non-Conforming Goods. Product that is either rejected by SutroVax as not meeting the Required Standards, or that is
determined by the Laboratory not to meet such Required Standards, shall, [***], be returned by SutroVax to Sutro, or destroyed pursuant to Applicable
Law, at Sutro’s reasonable expense. Sutro shall replace any non-conforming Product(s) within the shortest possible time. SutroVax shall have no
responsibility to Sutro for the amounts invoiced for non-conforming Product(s), and shall be credited for any amounts paid, but shall pay Sutro the

shall not be less than [***], to the extent consistent with the require timeline for Sutro’s response) with respect to any matter that relates to SutroVax. In
addition, Sutro shall notify SutroVax of any occurrences or information that arise out of Sutro’s Manufacturing activities that have, or could reasonably
be expected to have, adverse regulatory compliance or reporting consequences concerning any Product(s) or which might otherwise be reasonably
expected to adversely affect the supply by Sutro of Product(s) to SutroVax.
6.6 Changes or Modifications in Manufacturing Activities. Sutro shall not make any changes to the Specifications, processes, Facilities, raw materials,
raw material suppliers or any other item that would affect the Manufacturing activities related to the Product (a “ Manufacturing Change”) that (a) would
require a change to the applicable Drug Master File, (b) would be reasonably expected to cause SutroVax to be materially delayed obtaining any
Regulatory Approval with respect to Vaccine Compositions or (c) causes the Product to not meet the Specification therefor (including the Activity Test
with respect to Extract); without SutroVax’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delated). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sutro shall promptly make and implement such changes as are required by Applicable Law provided that, prior to implementation, Sutro shall
provide notice thereof to SutroVax and confer with SutroVax with respect to its timelines, estimated effect on Price and other issues regarding such
implementation. Sutro shall provide SutroVax at least [***] days’ written notice prior to implementing any Manufacturing Change. Sutro shall not make
any change to the Specification for a Product without SutroVax’s prior written consent. In addition, SutroVax shall have the right to request changes in or
modifications to the Specifications and Sutro will consider in good faith any such requested changes or modifications. All such changes or modifications
shall be documented in writing and shall be signed by an authorized representative of SutroVax and Sutro. If such changes or modifications result in a
material change in Sutro’s Manufacturing costs or lead times, the Parties shall agree upon an appropriate adjustment to the Price or in the delivery
schedules, as the case may be, for Product(s) to be provided by Sutro hereunder. Sutro shall promptly implement any agreed upon changes to the
Specifications.6.7 Quality Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, the Parties shall enter into a quality agreement governing Sutro’s

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
11.1 Principal Contacts. Each Party will appoint an individual employed by it to serve as its “Principal Contact” for purposes of this Supply Agreement.
Either Party may from time to time replace its Principal Contact with a different employee, but unless required due to events beyond its control, neither
Party will replace its Principal Contact without at least [***] days prior notice to the other Party. The two Principal Contacts shall communicate with each
other regularly during the Term as the Parties may agree or as the Principal Contacts shall mutually determine to be useful.
11.2 Escalation. The Parties intend that, to the maximum extent practicable, they shall reach decisions hereunder cooperatively through discussions
among the Principal Contacts and by mutual consent of the Parties. In situations in which that does not occur, disputes or differences arising out of or in
connection with this Supply Agreement shall initially be referred for review by the Parties’ respective Senior Managements (as defined below). Such
Senior Managements shall discuss the proposed dispute or difference, and shall meet with respect thereto if either of them believes a meeting or meetings
are likely to be useful. If the Senior Managements do not resolve the dispute or difference within [***] days (or such lesser or longer period as they may
agree is a useful period for their discussions), then either Party may pursue its other available remedies, consistent with this Supply Agreement. As used
herein, Sutro’s “Senior Management” means its then-current CEO, and SutroVax’s “Senior Management” means its then-current CEO. For clarity, there
shall be no obligation for any Disputed Matter arising out of Section 2.14 or 2.15 to be referred to the Senior Management to review prior to such matters
being resolved by arbitration pursuant to Sections 11.3 and 11.4.
11.3 Arbitration. If the Senior Managements are not able to resolve such dispute referred to them under Section 11.2 within such [***] day period, then
such dispute shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration as follows: The Parties shall select a mutually agreeable arbitrator who has significant
relevant experience in the subject matter of the disputed issue and no affiliation or pre-existing relationship with either Party. If the Parties cannot agree
on an arbitrator within [***] days after the end of the [***] day period referred in Section 11.2 (or with respect to a Disputed Matter described in Section
11.4, after referral by a Party of such Disputed Matter to arbitration), either Party may request the Judicial and Mediation Services (“ JAMS”) in San
Francisco, CA to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Parties in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of JAMS, and the proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with JAMS rules. The arbitrator may decide any issue as to whether, or as to the extent to which, any dispute is subject to the
arbitration and other dispute resolution provisions in this Supply Agreement. The arbitrator must base the award on the provisions of this Supply
Agreement and must render the award in a writing which must include an explanation of the reasons for such award. Judgment upon the award rendered
by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s fees and expenses shall be shared equally by the Parties, unless
the arbitrator in the award assesses such fees and expenses against one of the Parties or allocates such fees and expenses other than equally between the
Parties. Each Party shall bear and pay its own expenses incurred in connection with any dispute resolution under this Section 11.3. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either Party shall have the right, without waiving any right or remedy available to such Party under this Supply Agreement or otherwise, to
seek and obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary or desirable to protect the rights or property of
such Party, pending the selection of the arbitrator hereunder or pending the arbitrator’s decision of the dispute subject to arbitration.11.4 Baseball Arbitration. In the event (a) the Parties do not enter into a Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement as described in Section 2.14 or (b) the
Parties do not enter into a Transfer Addendum as described in Section 2.15 (“ Disputed Matter”), then upon either Party’s request with respect to the
Disputed Matter in clause (a) or SutroVax’s request with respect to the Disputed Matter in clause (b), such Disputed Matter shall be resolved by binding
arbitration conducted pursuant to Section 11.3, except that the procedures for the conduct of such arbitration shall be as follows:
11.4.1 Each Party shall provide the arbitrator and the other Party with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance of such
Disputed Matter and a full draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, and may submit a revised report, position
and draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, to the arbitrator within [***] days of receiving the other Party’s
report and draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable. If so requested by the arbitrator, each Party shall make oral
and/or other written submissions to the arbitrator in accordance with procedures to be established by the arbitrator; provided that other Party shall have
the right to be present during any oral submissions. The arbitrator shall select one of the Party’s draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer
Addendum, as applicable, as his or her decision, based on what is most reasonable and equitable to each of the Parties under the circumstances and
reflective of reasonable and customary terms in the biopharmaceutical industry for agreements of this type and most closely reflects the Parties’ intent as
expressed in this Supply Agreement and the License Agreement, and shall not have the authority to render any substantive decision other than to so
select the draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, of Sutro or SutroVax (as initially submitted, or as revised in
accordance with the foregoing, as applicable). For clarity, it is understood that the Parties intend the arbitration under this Section 11.4 to be a “baseball
arbitration” type proceeding; and the arbitrator may fashion such detailed procedures as the arbitrator considers appropriate to implement this intent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum contain any provision
granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicensees any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How.
11.4.2 In any arbitration under this Section 11.4, the arbitrator and the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve such Disputed Matter within [***]
days after the selection of the arbitrator, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
ARTICLE 12
MISCELLANEOUS
12.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Party shall bear its own costs, fees and expenses incurred by such Party in
connection with this Supply Agreement.
12.2 Licenses and Permits. Each Party shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain in full force and affect all necessary licenses, permits, and other
authorizations required by Applicable Law in order to carry out its duties and obligations hereunder.12.3 Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable for a failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this Supply Agreement if, but only to the
extent that such failure or delay is due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including: (a) acts of God; (b) fire, explosion, or
unusually severe weather; (c) war, invasion, riot, terrorism, or other civil unrest; (d) governmental laws, orders, restrictions, actions, embargo or
blockages; (e) national or regional emergency; (f) strikes or industrial disputes at a national level which directly impact the affected Party’s performance
under this Supply Agreement; or (g) other similar cause outside of the reasonable control of such Party (“ Force Majeure”); provided that the Party
affected shall promptly notify the other of the Force Majeure condition and shall use reasonable efforts to eliminate, cure or overcome any such causes
and resume performance of its obligations as soon as possible. If the performance of any obligation of a Party under this Supply Agreement is delayed
owing to such a Force Majeure for any continuous period of more than [***] days, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Supply
Agreement.
12.4 Neither Party may assign or transfer this Supply Agreement, including by merger, operation of law, or otherwise, without the other Party’s prior
written consent (which shall not be withheld unreasonably) except each Party may assign this Supply Agreement without the other Party’s consent in the
case of assignment or transfer to a Third Party that succeeds to all or substantially all of the assigning Party’s business and assets relating to the subject
matter of this Supply Agreement, whether by sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise. Any attempted assignment by a Party in violation of this Section
without the written consent of the other Party will be null and void. Except as above limited, this Supply Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the
benefit of each of the Parties, its successors and assigns. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that a Party is acquired, the acquiring Party shall
agree in writing to abide by the terms of this Supply Agreement. Sutro agrees that if it assigns the License Agreement to any successor as allowed under
section 15.1 of the License Agreement, it will also assign to such successor this Supply Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.4.
12.5 This Supply Agreement incorporates the Exhibits referenced herein. This Supply Agreement, together with the License Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties hereto with respect to its subject
matter. To the extent of any conflict between this Agreement and the License Agreement, the License Agreement shall govern and control.
12.6 All notices, requests or other communication provided for or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be hand delivered or sent by
confirmed facsimile, reputable courier or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address set forth below, or to
such other address of which either Party may inform the other in writing. Notices will be deemed delivered on the earliest of transmission by facsimile,

12.7 This Supply Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only in a writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby.
12.8 If any provision of this Supply Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent
permitted by law and the Parties’ fundamental intentions hereunder, and the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired.
12.9 Nothing herein contained shall constitute this a joint venture agreement and nothing herein shall constitute any Party as a partner, principal or agent
of any other, this being an agreement between independent contracting entities. Except as expressly set forth herein, no Party shall have the authority to

specific performance) without the requirement to post a bond, provided the waiver by such Party of the other Party’s requirement to post a bond shall
expire on the Change of Control of the other Party, and each party agrees that the arbitrator selected under Section 11.3 shall have the power to grant
such injunctive relief (or order specific performance). The Parties shall comply with any such injunctive relief (including specific performance) ordered by
the arbitrator and agree that such order may, to the extent not precluded by applicable law, be enforceable as a final award in any court of competent

shall have no obligation to agree to any amendment to this Agreement or such Third Party Supply Agreement that can reasonably
be expected to materially disadvantage Vericel or MediWound, respectively.
2.6 Facilities.
(a) Current and Expanded Capacity. The Parties agree and acknowledge that, as of the Effective Date, MediWound’s current
Facility can fill orders from Vericel for use in the Territory up to [***] of Intermediate Drug Product, whether provided in that form
or in the form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product within a calendar year (“Maximum Capacity”). The Parties agree and
acknowledge that the Facility will require either expansion or modification (which may include moving to or adding another

expansion of its annual manufacturing capacity to be [***] of Intermediate Drug Product (whether provided in that form or in the
form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product). The Parties will in good faith review existing market research to mutually agree
on peak anticipated volume prior to [***]. After the foregoing expansion, the expanded capacity shall be deemed the “Maximum
Capacity” for purposes of this Agreement. As part of the expansion of the Facility, the Parties will discuss any shut down or
transfer to another facility made in connection therewith.
(b) Shut-Down or Expansion of Facility; Transfer to Another Facility. In the event that MediWound desires to cease or shut down
operations at a Facility, expand or modify a Facility, or transfer the Manufacturing of a Product to another facility which would
reasonably be anticipated to result in inability (permanent or temporary) of MediWound to Manufacture, supply or otherwise
perform its obligations hereunder, MediWound shall provide prior written notice to Vericel within the applicable Change
Notification Period of such planned shut-down, cessation, expansion, modification or transfer. During such Change Notification
Period, Vericel

9012190/26will have the right to order, and in such case MediWound will manufacture, up to [***] of quantities of Product set forth in the
Rolling Forecast with respect to such Change Notification Period which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, MediWound shall remain obligated to supply Product at the then current Facility and will not supply
Product to Vericel from a new facility unless and until MediWound can perform the Manufacturing and supply Product from such
new Facility in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any modifications to the regulatory filings for such Product are
approved by the relevant Regulatory Authorities. MediWound shall bear all costs incurred in connection with the shut-down,
cessation, expansion or modification of the Facility or transfer of the Manufacturing of a Product to a new facility pursuant to this
Section 2.6(b), including any costs associated with changes to the regulatory filings. Once such new facility is able to Manufacture
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all required regulatory changes have been approved, such new facility shall be
the Facility for purposes of such Product under this Agreement.
2.7 Establishment of Second Source.
(a) Within [***] of the Effective Date, MediWound must provide Vericel with true and accurate copies of all documents consistent
with Schedule 2.7. If MediWound does not provide all documents within [***] of the Effective Date, Vericel’s obligation under
Section 8.1 regarding the time period to provide MediWound with a notice of an extension of the Initial Term shall be extended by
the amount of time beyond [***] taken by MediWound to provide the required documents.
(b) Within [***] of a request by Vericel to initiate technology transfer or as soon as reasonably practicable upon request by Vericel
in connection with a Supply Failure, MediWound shall provide Vericel, at Vericel’s cost consistent with Schedule 4.5, with
information necessary for Vericel to qualify a second or back-up supplier identified by Vericel for the Manufacture and supply of
Product (a “Second Source”) and facilitate technology transfer to such Second Source so that Vericel can consistently
manufacture intermediate and final product that meets all specifications. MediWound will notify the IIA in accordance with
applicable Israeli Laws upon the commencement of Manufacture of Product by such Second Source. MediWound will provide
Vericel with access to the manufacturing process and information and any and all original processes, records, and any other
information required to manufacture, package and test the Product in accordance with the Specifications. Second Source
manufacturers shall be permitted to manufacture Product for Vericel, its Affiliates and Sublicensees as provided in Section 9.1 and
the License Agreement; provided that such Second Source manufacturers: [***].
2.8 Forecasting and Ordering.
(a) Forecasting. Vericel shall furnish MediWound with a [***] rolling forecast of the quantities of each Product that Vericel intends
to order during the succeeding [***] period (each, a “Rolling Forecast”) which in any event will not exceed the Maximum
Capacity for the Binding Forecast. No later than [***] after the filing of a BLA, Vericel shall
8
9012190/26furnish MediWound the first rolling Forecast. Subject to this Section 2.8, the [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall constitute a
binding order for the quantities of Product specified (“Binding Forecast”). The remaining [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall be
non-binding, but shall represent Vericel’s good faith estimate, as of the date of its submission of the Rolling Forecast, of its
forecasted requirements of the Product during such period. MediWound shall maintain at all times the manufacturing capacity at the
relevant Facility to manufacture [***] of the quantities of Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as
was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) which in any event will
not exceed the Maximum Capacity.
(b) Purchase Orders. On a Calendar Quarter basis, Vericel shall issue at least one Purchase Order for the number and unit size of
each Product specified in the Binding Forecast. Vericel is not limited to one Purchase Order per Calendar Quarter. Each Purchase
Order shall specify (i) a purchase order number; (ii) the quantity of units of each Product to be Manufactured; and (iii) the
requested delivery date of such Product (which in no event shall be earlier than [***] days following the date the applicable
Purchase Order was received by MediWound). MediWound shall respond to each Purchase Order within [***] of receipt by: (i)
accepting such Purchase Order if it conforms to the requirements of this Agreement or (ii) notifying Vericel if such Purchase Order
does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement. If MediWound timely notifies Vericel that a Purchase Order does not
conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Parties shall confer as soon as reasonably practicable to resolve any issues
related to such purported nonconformity. If MediWound fails to respond to a Purchase Order that is consistent with the Binding
Forecast within [***] after receiving it, Vericel will, within [***] thereafter, confirm with MediWound that such Purchase Order
was received by MediWound, and if such Purchase Order is consistent with the Binding Forecast and was properly submitted by
Vericel in accordance with this Section 2.8(b), MediWound shall be deemed to have accepted such Purchase Order (“Binding
Order”) as of the date of MediWound’s receipt of such Purchase Order. If a Purchase Order contains quantities of Products in
excess of the quantity of such Product forecasted for such quarter (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately
prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) by an amount greater than [***] of the Binding Forecast (“Excess Amount”),
MediWound will accept the Purchase Order up to, but not including the Excess Amount which in any event will not exceed the
Maximum Capacity. Should Vericel place a Purchase Order to procure a given Product in a given Calendar Quarter which
includes an Excess Amount, MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet Vericel’s request. If there is a conflict
between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, this Agreement shall govern.
(c) Minimum Purchase Obligation. In each Calendar Year following Vericel’s submission of the first Rolling Forecast, Vericel shall
issue Purchase Orders for at least [***] of the quantities of each Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling
Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year).
(d) BARDA. As of the Effective Date, MediWound is a party to BARDA Contract HHSO100201500035C and BARDA
Contract HHSO100201800023C (collectively, the
9
9012190/26“BARDA Agreements”) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”). The Parties agree
that until commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, MediWound shall remain responsible
for the supply and other obligations and shall manage the forecasts and production schedule for such BARDA Agreements. During
such period, any Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will not be included in Purchase Orders, Binding Orders, Rolling
Forecasts or the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c); provided that the Product ordered by BARDA from
MediWound will be included in the Maximum Capacity and thus the applicable Maximum Capacity for the Binding Orders will be
adjusted accordingly. If and when commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, then Vericel
shall become responsible for including the applicable purchases by BARDA in its Purchase Orders, Binding Orders and Rolling
Forecasts and such purchases will be included in the Maximum Capacity and the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section
2.8(c).
2.9 Delivery.
(a) Shipping. MediWound shall only ship Products that have been Manufactured and released in accordance with the
Specifications. Unless agreed in advance by Vericel and MediWound in writing, MediWound shall not ship (or permit such Third
Party packager to ship) any Products prior to approval and release by MediWound in accordance with the Quality Agreement and
Regulatory Standards. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, Products shall be delivered to Vericel Ex-Works (Incoterms
2010), at MediWound’s facility (the “Delivery Site”) at which point, the title and risk of loss shall transfer to Vericel which shall
transfer the Products from the Delivery Site in accordance with cGMP as applicable. MediWound shall notify (or cause such Third
Party packager to notify) Vericel at least [***] prior to any shipment of Products.
(b) Delivery Amount. MediWound shall deliver Product within [***] of the units set out on the relevant Purchase Order. To the
extent that a delivery is in excess of [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel may accept such excess
Product provided that if Vericel accepts such excess, Vericel shall be entitled, (i) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to
vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following
shipment(s) of the applicable Product to the extent reasonably required due to the acceptance of such excess, and (ii) to reduce
subsequent Purchase Orders and take credits for the amount of excess Product received against the minimum purchase obligation
set forth in Section 2.8(c). To the extent that a delivery is less than [***] but at least [***] of the amount set out on the relevant
Purchase Order, Vericel shall accept such delivery and shall be entitled, (A) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the
delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of
the applicable Product due to the acceptance of such delivery, and (B) to increase subsequent Purchase Orders with the applicable
shortage quantities.
(c) On Time Delivery. MediWound’s performance with respect to “on time delivery” will be measured as delivery to Vericel [***]
before or after the delivery date agreed
10
9012190/26between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8; provided that MediWound shall be deemed to have made a
delivery during the “on time delivery” window if the delay in delivery to Vericel is due to Vericel’s failure to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement (including in connection with Vericel’s review of the Batch records).
2.10 Dating. The remaining shelf-life for each Product for the Territory shall be at least [***] of the FDA approved shelf-life of
such Product, as measured from the time of delivery of such Product to Vericel (the “Minimum Shelf Life”).
2.11 Safety Stock. MediWound shall be entitled to meet its obligation to maintain as safety stock not less than [***] of the Rolling
Forecast demand of stock of each of the Key Materials (the “Safety Stock”) so long as the Minimum Shelf Life has been satisfied
by holding either Product or an equivalent quantity of Materials, or a mixture of the two. The Parties will cooperate to set minimum
inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers. Vericel shall maintain an inventory of [***] supply of unlabeled
or labeled Finished Product in order to supply its commercial requirements in accordance with the Rolling Forecast, which may be
stored at Facility at Vericel’s option, cost and risk.
2.12 Non-Conforming Product.
(a) Rejection Notice. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, within [***] after receipt of a delivery of Product
hereunder, Vericel shall give MediWound written notice of rejection (“Rejection Notice”) (i) if the Product does not constitute
Conforming Product (“Non-Conforming Product”) or (ii) of any shortage in quantity of such delivery of Product. Any such
Rejection Notice provided with respect to any quantity of Product shall be deemed to apply to the full Batch of such Product
unless otherwise specified by Vericel. Vericel shall be deemed to have accepted such shipment of Product as Conforming Product
and any shortage in quantity if it does not provide Rejection Notice within [***] after receipt of delivery describing the reasons for
such rejections in reasonable detail, provided, however, that such [***] period shall not apply to any Latent Defects, in which
case Vericel shall notify MediWound of any such failure as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within [***] after the
Latent Defect is confirmed by Vericel and prior to expiration of the shelf-life for such Product.
(b) Disputes. In the event that MediWound disagrees with Vericel’s claim that Product fails to constitute Conforming Product, then
the Parties shall promptly attempt to resolve such dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute, a sample of such Product shall
be submitted by MediWound and Vericel to a mutually agreeable qualified Third Party laboratory for testing against the applicable
Specifications, Regulatory Standards and other standards and controls in the Quality Agreement and the test results obtained by
such laboratory shall be final and controlling (absent manifest error). Test results must be furnished to both Parties within [***] of
concluding such testing. The fees and expenses of such laboratory testing and any obsolescence due to short dating shall be borne
entirely by the Party whose original Product analysis was in error.
11
9012190/26(c) Remedy. On receipt of Vericel’s Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.12(a), subject to Section 2.12(b), MediWound shall,
[***] (except if such Non-Conforming Product is due to MediWound’s gross negligence or willful misconduct):
(i) deliver the appropriate shortage quantities of Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense
(including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel;
(ii) replace the Non-Conforming Product with Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense
(including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; or
(iii) promptly grant Vericel a credit in an amount equal to the amount paid or payable by Vericel with respect to reasonable out of
pocket expenses directly associated with the Non-Conforming Product to the extent applicable (e.g. shipment costs, destruction
fees, and restocking fees) and any such shortage or Non-Conforming Product, including, without limitation, but solely in the case of
Non-Conforming Product, expenses associated with destruction or return at MediWound’s instruction. This subsection (iii) shall
additionally apply in the event Vericel elects as its option the foregoing (i) or (ii), as applicable, and such delivery or replace of
Product thereunder is not practicable within a reasonable period of time (as reasonably determined by MediWound).
2.13 Shortages.
(a) Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Vericel, in the event of any shortage in the supply of any Materials or
Product, or if MediWound is for any other reason unable to supply Product in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then
MediWound will promptly notify Vericel and, in the event such inability is caused by a shortage of any Materials and/or capacity
required for the Manufacture of any Product, will take all commercially reasonable steps to (i) procure adequate quantities of
Materials from Third Party suppliers reasonably acceptable to Vericel, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all
Binding Orders for Product.
(b) Prior to a Second Source commencing supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of (i) any Materials required to
Manufacture Product or (ii) Product, MediWound will allocate the available Materials to the Manufacture of Product for sale to
Vericel and will allocate the available Product for sale to Vericel, in each case ((i) or (ii)), to the extent any Binding Orders then in
place prior to allocating such materials to the Manufacture of any other product (including EscharEx), or for any entity other than
Vericel.
(c) After a Second Source commences supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of Materials or Product, MediWound will
allocate to Vericel its pro rata share of MediWound’s supply of the same in a manner no less favorable than those of its equivalently
situated customers or MediWound’s own similarly situated products.
12
9012190/26(d) The Parties will cooperate to discuss expansion plans, address capacity and any other product supply issues, including efficient
use of resources, manufacturing schedules and shipping schedules.
2.14 Supply Failures. In the event that MediWound becomes aware of the existence of a situation that may lead to a Supply
Failure, then MediWound shall promptly (and in no event later than [***] from the date of such awareness) notify Vericel of the
particular circumstances. MediWound and Vericel shall promptly discuss how to resolve such circumstances in an effort to avoid or
mitigate such potential Supply Failure. MediWound shall investigate the root cause of the anticipated Supply Failure and prepare
and provide to Vericel a Remediation Plan within [***] of MediWound’s notice to Vericel. If the Remediation Plan is acceptable to
Vericel, and MediWound is able to reasonably assure Vericel of MediWound’s ability to Manufacture Product and, thereby, (a)
avoid a Supply Failure or (b) supply Product in accordance with the Rolling Forecast within [***], then MediWound shall continue
to Manufacture Product for Vericel. In all other cases, Vericel shall be permitted to take such measures as are reasonably
determined in good faith by Vericel to ensure the supply of Product to the marketplace including cancelling or revising outstanding
Purchase Orders and, at Vericel’s option, Vericel’s obligations under Section 2.8(a), (b) and (c) shall be deemed terminated.
ARTICLE 3 
COMPLIANCE, QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL
3.1 Certificates of Analysis; Release. MediWound shall perform, or cause to be performed testing and other activities on each
Batch of Product Manufactured pursuant to this Agreement before delivery to Vericel or Vericel’s designated Affiliate or contractor

MediWound agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit one or more
13
9012190/26Vericel representatives to be present for all or part of such visit or inspection if Vericel so requests. MediWound shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to Vericel a copy of all material information supplied and/or issued by any Regulatory
Authority to the extent that such report relates to the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, or the ability of
MediWound or the Suppliers to so Manufacture or supply hereunder, within [***] of its receipt of such information. Before
MediWound or any Supplier responds to any Regulatory Authority where such correspondence would reasonably be expected to
have a material impact on the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, Vericel will be provided a reasonable
opportunity, unless prohibited by applicable Law, to review and comment on the portion of such response related thereto,
provided that Vericel shall conduct such review and provide such comments reasonably in advance of when any such response is
due to such Regulatory Authority, and further provided that nothing herein, including failure by Vericel to provide such timely
review and comment, shall in any way restrict MediWound or its Suppliers from taking, and MediWound and its Suppliers shall at
all times be permitted to take, such actions or inactions necessary for its and their compliance with applicable Law. With respect to
any and all requirements of a Regulatory Authority for the Manufacture of Product for Commercialization in the Territory following
the First Commercial Sale of the Product in a country in the Territory, the Parties shall discuss in good faith such requirements and
allocation of responsibility between the Parties.
3.4 Audit.
(a) Vericel shall have the right from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, but not more than [***] (unless (i) otherwise
agreed between the Parties or (ii) if Section 3.4(b) below applies) during normal business hours and upon not less than [***] prior

Manufacturing Product in order to carry out a cGMP quality and compliance audit of those parts of the Facility involved in or
which could have any impact on Manufacture of such Product (including those used for storing, warehousing and/or testing and
utilities), including for the purpose of confirming that no types of product which could reasonably be expected to impact the quality
of the Product are being manufactured on site in deviation of cGMP.
(b) In addition to the rights set out in Section 3.4(a), where (i) any audit carried out in accordance with this Section 3.4 has
identified any breach of this Agreement, (ii) Vericel has a reasonable basis to suspect a breach of this Agreement, (iii) any previous
audit carried out in accordance with this Section 3.4 has identified any major or critical findings, or (iv) if such audit is in response
to or following an audit from a regulatory agency, and such audit resulted in a 483 or equivalent citation, then Vericel shall have the
right to carry out, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, follow up compliance audit(s).
(c) MediWound shall be solely responsible for ensuring the cGMP compliance status of subcontractors (where such subcontractors
are carrying out activities to which cGMP applies) used in relation to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
14
9012190/26(d) MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the right for Vericel to have the same inspection rights
described in this Section 3.4 at the premises of any such subcontractor, and if unable to procure such rights, shall carry out such
audits itself and shall report its non-confidential findings to Vericel.
(e) The above obligations of MediWound and rights of Vericel shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the rights of MediWound and
obligations of Vericel with respect to the undertaking of Vericel and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors to comply with the
cGMP as applicable to their activities and the related audit rights to ensure such compliance.
3.5 Results of Audits and /or Regulatory Inspection. Observations and conclusions of Vericel’s audits will be issued to
MediWound, which materials shall be deemed Confidential Information, provided that any Confidential Information of MediWound
contained therein or upon which such observations and conclusions are based shall remain the Confidential Information of
MediWound. MediWound and Vericel shall, at Vericel’s expense (unless the result is due to a material breach of MediWound of
any of its obligations under this Agreement), (a) cooperate to determine the cause for any identified issues, (b) work together in
good faith to develop a corrective action, and (c) endeavor to implement such corrective action within a mutually agreed time
period thereafter.
3.6 Regulatory Information. MediWound shall promptly disclose to Vericel, upon its request, information in MediWound’s
possession required for Vericel to obtain and maintain any and all needed permits, approvals, or licenses issued by any and all
Regulatory Authorities relating to the Manufacture, storage, packaging, and sale of a Product, as the case may be. MediWound
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause Suppliers to, provide to Vericel in a reasonable, timely manner (including within a
reasonable period prior to the due date of Vericel’s annual report to an applicable Regulatory Authority with respect to the
Product), all information in its or their respective possession which Vericel requires regarding the Product in order to comply with
such Regulatory Standards. MediWound shall provide new regulatory correspondence related to the Product as soon as possible
but in no event less than [***].
3.7 Recall. Any decision to initiate a Recall of a Product in a country in the Territory shall be made by the marketing approval
holder and shall be made in compliance with and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, after consultation between the Parties.
Vericel’s and its Affiliates’, Sublicensees’ and Distributors’ costs (including internal costs of Vericel) associated with any such
Recall shall be borne solely by Vericel (including refunds to customers); provided, however, that all out of pocket expenses
associated with a Recall (including those of Vericel and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors and refunds to customers) shall
be borne solely by MediWound to the extent such Recall (a) arises from or is caused directly by any breach by MediWound of this
Agreement, the License Agreement or the Quality Agreement, or MediWound’s or any of its Affiliates’, Suppliers’ or
subcontractors’ negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) resulting directly from MediWound’s failure to supply Product that
conforms to the applicable Product Warranty. MediWound shall cooperate in the implementation of any Recall of Product in the
Territory, as required by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Vericel and, for such a Recall, the cost of such cooperation
shall be at Vericel’s reasonable
15
9012190/26expense (except to the extent the Recall results from the matters described in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b)).
3.8 Quality Agreement. Each Party shall perform the duties required of it pursuant to a quality agreement to be entered into by the
Parties within [***] of the execution of this Agreement (the “Quality Agreement”). To the extent the Quality Agreement either
conflicts with this Agreement or is silent on an issue addressed, this Agreement shall control, except to the extent the matter is
strictly a quality matter, in which event the Quality Agreement shall supersede this Agreement solely with respect to such quality
matter.
ARTICLE 4
CHANGES
4.1 Changes. MediWound shall not change the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the Manufacture of Product for supply
to Vericel for the Territory hereunder except as expressly permitted pursuant to this Article 4. Each Party shall notify the other
Party of any change in the Regulatory Standards applicable to the Manufacturing of Product for the supply to Vericel for the
Territory that could reasonably affect the obligations of MediWound under this Agreement. All changes shall include an assessment
of the need for regulatory submission and approval by a method to be defined in the Quality Agreement. The applicable notification
period for any change or proposed change by a Party to the Manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product or Key
Materials, the Facility and other Manufacturing changes (the “Change Notification Period”) is set forth on Schedule 4.1.
4.2 Changes to Facility. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 2.6 and this Article 4, MediWound shall not perform
any change of any part of any Facility, change the physical location within the Facility for Manufacturing any Products or change
the Facility at which the Manufacturing of any Products takes place, if such change would reasonably be expected to (a) impact
the Regulatory Approval for one or more of the Products or any regulatory compliance program; or (b) result in inability
(permanent or temporary) of MediWound to Manufacture, supply or otherwise perform its obligations per Vericel’s Rolling
Forecast in accordance with this Agreement. For any change in the Facility at which the Manufacturing of any Products takes
place, MediWound shall (i) give Vericel notice within the applicable Change Notification Period, and (ii) provide Vericel a plan for
avoiding any interruption in supply that may result from such change. In the event of a “Major” change to the Facility (as detailed in
Schedule 4.1), such change will be treated in accordance with Section 2.6(b).
4.3 Discretionary Manufacturing Changes. Vericel may propose changes to the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the
supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory that are not Regulatory Changes (any such change, a “Discretionary
Manufacturing Change”). If agreed to by MediWound, MediWound or its Suppliers will use commercially reasonable efforts to
make such proposed changes, and Vericel will bear [***] of the costs associated with such changes. MediWound may propose
changes to the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the supply of Product for the Territory that are not Regulatory
Changes. MediWound shall propose any such Discretionary Manufacturing Change in accordance with the applicable
16
9012190/26Change Notification Period prior to the proposed implementation. [***]. Vericel shall, within [***] of receipt of MediWound’s
notice, notify MediWound in writing whether Vericel accepts or rejects the proposed change, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed unless consultations with regulatory authorities are required to assess the impact of such
proposed change.
4.4 Regulatory Changes.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision under this Agreement to the contrary, if either Party receives notice, or is otherwise
informed of, any change to the Manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product or Key Materials, the Facility or any change
that has an impact of the obligations of Vericel or MediWound under this Agreement that is required by applicable Law or that is
otherwise required by any applicable Regulatory Authority (any such change, a “Regulatory Change”), such Party shall promptly
deliver notice thereof to the other Party. Within the applicable Change Notification Period, MediWound shall notify Vericel in
writing of MediWound’s good faith and reasonable determination as to (i) whether MediWound is technically able to comply with
such Regulatory Change, (ii) whether the Regulatory Change would adversely affect MediWound’s ability to timely manufacture
and supply any Product supplied hereunder and (iii) the costs to implement such Regulatory Change. MediWound shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Key Material Suppliers to provide such notice of any Regulatory Change to MediWound
or Vericel.
(b) If MediWound determines it is technically unable to comply with the Regulatory Change at the Facility in the timeframe required
by the applicable Regulatory Authority, then, in MediWound’s discretion, it shall have the right to transfer the Manufacturing of the
applicable Product to an alternative facility of MediWound that is qualified and approved for Manufacturing such Product in
accordance with this Agreement, if available. In the event MediWound is unable to supply Product as a result of such Regulatory
Change, Vericel, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to source all or any portion of Vericel’s requirements of the applicable
Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party, including from the Second Source.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if as a result of a Regulatory Change, MediWound is unable
to Manufacture and supply a Product to Vericel, Vericel shall be entitled to source such Product, until MediWound regains the
ability to supply Product, from a Third Party or Second Source in accordance with this Section 4.4(b), in which case MediWound
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Vericel with reasonable technical assistance with regard to transferring the
technology relating to the Product to such Third Party, and the Parties shall discuss the allocation of such costs related to such
transfer, including MediWound’s expenses and any incremental costs of supply of such Product and Materials from such Third
Party consistent with Schedule 4.5.
(c) If MediWound determines it is technically able to implement a Regulatory Change required by a Regulatory Authority in the
Territory, the costs for such Regulatory Change shall be borne by Vericel consistent with Schedule 4.5.
17
9012190/264.5 Ongoing Regulatory Assistance. Within [***] following Vericel’s request, MediWound shall provide technical data and
assistance in answering Vericel’s questions (a) for regulatory filings and for process changes initiated by MediWound at no cost to
Vericel, (b) for process changes initiated by Vericel at the cost of Vericel for the applicable number of hours at a Full Time
Equivalent rate described in Schedule 4.5, (c) for new regulatory registrations, which shall be at Vericel’s cost, and (d) for periodic
regulatory reporting and questions from regulatory authorities, which shall be at the cost of Vericel.
ARTICLE 5 
PRICE AND PAYMENT TERMS
5.1 Supply Price. On a Product-by-Product basis, the price payable in U.S. Dollars by Vericel for supply of such Product for a
given Calendar Year shall be as set forth on a per unit basis on Exhibit A (with respect to each Product, the “Supply Price”),
which shall be updated on a Calendar Year basis in accordance with Section 5.2 below.
5.2 Price Mechanics.
(a) Beginning on [***] (each, a “Re-Pricing Date”), MediWound may annually increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.2. MediWound may increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year if the United States
Producer Price Index (Chemical Manufacturing) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the “PPI”) [***] and (b) in the event
the PPI [***]. MediWound shall give Vericel at least [***] prior written notice of any such adjustment to the Supply Price.
(b) In addition to the foregoing price adjustment mechanism, MediWound may propose an adjustment to the Supply Price to
reflect changes that substantially affect MediWound’s costs or ability to supply Product. MediWound shall provide Vericel with
written notice of such changes and its proposed adjustment and provide appropriate documentation demonstrating that the price
adjustment is required. Following Vericel’s receipt of such notice and documentation, the Parties will engage in good faith
discussions to negotiate a mutually agreed upon adjustment to the Supply Price, if any.
(c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the adjusted Supply Price will be the Supply Price for the next applicable Purchase
Order placed after Vericel’s receipt of notification of the adjusted Supply Price, and shall apply to each Purchase Order placed
thereafter until the next adjustment is made (if any) in accordance with the above mechanism.
5.3 Cost Savings. Either Party may propose changes to any Manufacturing process in order to obtain efficiencies and cost savings
in such process (“Cost Savings Change”). The proposing Party shall submit to the other Party a proposal detailing the Cost
Savings Change, the implementation of such Cost Savings Change, and the analysis of the expected efficiencies and cost savings
from such Cost Savings Change. If Vericel proposes a Cost Savings Change and (a) MediWound determines it is technically able
to implement the Cost Savings Change, (b) the Cost Savings Change would not materially adversely affect the applicable Facility,
and (c) Vericel agrees to pay the costs to implement such Costs Saving Change as an Additional Service Fee,
18
9012190/26MediWound shall agree to implement such proposed change which MediWound shall not unreasonably decline to implement. If
MediWound proposes a Cost Savings Change and the Parties agree to its implementation, (i) Vericel shall pay MediWound the
agreed amount to implement such change as an Additional Service Fee prior to the implementation of such Cost Savings Change;
and (ii) MediWound shall make its reasonable commercial efforts to implement such Cost Savings Change pursuant to a mutually
agreed upon schedule. In the event cost savings are actually achieved, then the cost saving will be [***] between the Parties (i.e.
[***] of the cost savings shall be added to the new discounted Supply Price).
5.4 Payments. Unless specified otherwise, any payment to be made by Vericel under this Agreement shall be made within [***]
from date of invoice. It is hereby agreed that the invoice with respect to any shipment will be issued upon the delivery date. The
Parties’ respective rights and responsibilities under Sections 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 of the License Agreement shall apply as such Section
pertains to the Parties’ performance under this Agreement, and are hereby incorporated by reference.
5.5 Late Payments. Any payments due under this Agreement shall be due on such date as specified in this Agreement and, in the
event such date is not a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day. In the event that any payment due under this
Agreement is not made when due, the amount due shall accrue interest beginning on the [***] following the date on which such
payment was due, calculated at the [***] for the due date, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law, calculated from the
due date until paid in full. Each payment made after the due date shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Party shall have recourse to any other remedy available at law or in equity with respect to any delinquent payment,
subject to the terms of this Agreement.
5.6 Taxes. Vericel shall be responsible for the payment of any value added or similar tax (but excluding, for avoidance of doubt,
any tax on the income of MediWound) on the Products delivered by MediWound to Vericel, to the extent such taxes are itemized
and included on a valid invoice and required to be collected from Vericel under applicable Law. In addition, in the event any
payments made by Vericel pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the Laws or regulations of any
jurisdiction or Governmental Authority, Vericel shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of MediWound
to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations; such amounts payable to MediWound shall be reduced by the amount of
taxes deducted and withheld; and Vericel shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely
manner and transmit to MediWound an official tax certificate or other evidence of such tax obligations together with proof of
payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required
under applicable Laws or regulations to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, MediWound. Each Party
agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any
relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect. The Parties shall discuss applicable mechanisms for minimizing such taxes to the
extent possible in compliance with applicable Laws. Vericel will provide MediWound with reasonable assistance to enable
MediWound to recover such taxes as permitted by applicable Laws or regulations.

intentional acts of MediWound or any MediWound Indemnified Party or (z) MediWound is required to indemnify Vericel pursuant
to Section 7.1.
7.3 No Right of Indemnification under License Agreement. No right of indemnification shall exist under the License Agreement for
claims arising out of the performance of this Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that such claims shall be solely governed
by the provisions of this Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in Section 7.6, no limits on indemnification
or liability set forth in the License Agreement shall apply to this Agreement.
7.4 Procedure.
(a) Notice. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing in the event it becomes aware of a claim for which indemnification may
be sought hereunder. In the event that any Third Party asserts a claim or other proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) with respect to any matter for which a Party (the “Indemnified Party”) is entitled to indemnification hereunder (a
“Third Party Claim”), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Party obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the
“Indemnifying Party”) thereof; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.
(b) Control. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any Third Party Claim, to assume direction and control
of the defense, litigation, settlement, appeal or other disposition of the Third Party Claim (including the right to settle the claim
solely for monetary consideration) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment that is sought, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks solely monetary
damages and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim in full (the conditions set forth
in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above are collectively referred to as the “Litigation Conditions”). Within [***] after the Indemnifying
Party has given notice to the Indemnified Party of its exercise of its right to defend a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
give notice to the Indemnifying Party of any objection thereto based upon the Litigation Conditions. If the Indemnified Party
reasonably so objects, the Indemnified Party shall continue to defend the Third Party Claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, until such time as
22
9012190/26such objection is withdrawn. If no such notice is given, or if any such objection is withdrawn, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to assume direction and control of such defense, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. During such time as the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and agents to cooperate upon request
of the Indemnifying Party, in the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim, including by furnishing such records, information
and testimony and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may reasonably be requested
by the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Conditions or does not notify the
Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party’s intent to defend any Third Party Claim within [***] after notice thereof, the
Indemnified Party may (without further notice to the Indemnifying Party) undertake the defense thereof with counsel of its choice
and at the Indemnifying Party’s expense (including reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and costs and expenses of
enforcement or defense). The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to join in

(subject to Section 4.2 of the License Agreement) license under the MediWound Technology and MediWound’s interest in the
Joint Technology, to Manufacture and have Manufactured Licensed Products in the Territory for use in the Field in the Territory.
9.2 Trademarks License Grant. MediWound hereby grants to Vericel an exclusive (even as to MediWound), sublicensable, royalty-
free, fully paid-up, license in the Territory to use the Licensed Trademarks (as defined in the License Agreement) and a non-
exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, license to use the MediWound name and trademark, in
25
9012190/26each case, in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory. All uses of the Licensed Trademarks by
Vericel (and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors) in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the
Territory shall be in accordance with Regulatory Approvals and all applicable Laws and MediWound’s quality control guidelines
for the Licensed Trademarks, as may be amended from time to time. Vericel (and its Affiliates) shall only use the Licensed
Trademarks licensed hereunder in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in the Territory. Vericel shall not (and
shall cause its Affiliates, Sublicensee and Distributors not to) use such Licensed Trademarks to identify, or in connection with the
marketing of, any other products.
9.1 Ownership. Ownership of all inventions and discoveries made by the Parties in the course of Manufacturing and supply of the
Product hereunder (including Manufacture and supply of Product) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the License
Agreement.
ARTICLE 10 
FORCE MAJEURE
10.1 Excusing Performance. Neither Party shall be liable for the failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent
such failure is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes,
hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorist acts,
insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances involving the workforce of any Third Party, or
acts of God (a “Force Majeure Event”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the occurrence of a Force Majeure
Event will not excuse or prevent a failure of MediWound to deliver Product from being deemed a “Supply Failure” or otherwise
limit Vericel’s rights, to the extent applicable, under Section 2.13.
10.2 Notice of Force Majeure Event. A Party claiming a right to be excused from performance under Section 10.1 shall
immediately notify the other Party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice shall specify the Force Majeure
Event and the estimated likely period of time during which its performance will be affected.
10.3 Resumption; Termination. A non-performing Party as a result of a Force Majeure Event shall use reasonable best efforts, at
its own expense, to eliminate the Force Majeure Event and to mitigate the effect of such cause and resume performance under this
Agreement, in each case, as soon as practicable and for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues. Further, consistent with
diligent risk management practices, MediWound will keep current a risk management program. If MediWound is affected by any
Force Majeure Event, MediWound agrees to perform its obligations under this Section 10.3 to mitigate the effect thereof and
resume performance under this Agreement in the same manner as MediWound would use to resolve any similar disruptions
affecting its own products (including EscharEx). MediWound shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the impact of the
Force Majeure Event shall not be relatively greater for Vericel than it is for MediWound with respect to MediWound’s products
(including EscharEx).

request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
Page 17 of 28HEMISPHERX may perform audits for initial qualification of SCIEN as well as periodic audits and “for cause” audits. At mutually agreed upon
times, HEMISPHERX may review standard operating and other quality control procedures and records and the records of  SCIEN relating to the
Agreement. Such routine and general oversight review is to be requested at least twenty (20) business days in advance, limited to two (2) persons,
completed within one (1) to two (2) business days and shall be offered to HEMISPHERX one (1) time each calendar year. SCIEN will make every
reasonable effort to accommodate the special circumstances that may arise pursuant to “for cause” audits. The following applies to all audits:

7. Definitions
 
Adverse experience: Any adverse event associated with the use of a biological or drug product in humans, whether or not considered product
related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a biological or drug product in professional practice; an
adverse event occurring from overdose of the product whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from abuse of the product; an
adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.
 
Disability: A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
 
Life-threatening adverse experience: Any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death
from the adverse experience as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have
caused death.
 
Labeled event: An adverse experience that is listed on the product insert as having been observed in patients who are receiving the drug product.
 
{***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment
request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
Page 18 of 28Drug Product: A finished dosage form, for example, tablet, capsule, or solution that contains an active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in
association with inactive ingredients
 
Serious adverse experience: Any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening
adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be
considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
 
Unexpected adverse experience: Any adverse experience that is not listed in the current labelling for the biological or drug product. This includes
events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labelling, but differ from the event because of greater
severity or specificity.
 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated
hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if
the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, refers to an adverse experience that has not been
previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the
pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.
 
Call report: A list of all questions, requests for circulars, and physician/patient complaints received by  SCIEN's Clinical Support Department is
prepared monthly by SCIEN staff and is forwarded to HEMISPHERX RA/QA Department.
 
Audit: A systematic examination of processes, controls and systems, operating procedures, reports, records and/or data to assess  SCIEN’s
compliance with standards, regulatory submissions, SOPs; applicable laws, regulations, directives, standards and guidelines; the terms of this
Agreement and other contracts in place defining the services being provided and to verify data integrity.
 
Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”): Good clinical practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing,
conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public
assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration
of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible. ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance.
 
Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”): The recognized pharmaceutical regulations and requirements of regulatory authorities such as those
defined by the U.S. FDA’s regulations at 21CFR Parts 210 and 211.
 
Key Contacts: Persons at SCIEN and HEMISPHERX assigned to assure proper communication and follow-up in a timely manner within both
parties’ organizations. Names, titles and full contact information for Key Contacts shall be appended to this Agreement as Attachment 1 and should
be maintained up-to-date during the course of the project.
 
Observation: A statement of fact made during an audit that is substantiated by objective evidence. HEMISPHERX categorizes observations as
follows:
 
o Critical: May pose risk to patient or consumer or otherwise compromise the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or
service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a critical observation include: A practice that poses an immediate safety
risk to personnel; Quality System(s) missing or not in compliance with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies.

additional and contrary terms, the terms and conditions of all Purchase Orders are incorporated by reference into this Agreement for all
applicable purposes hereunder. Without limitation of anything contained in this clause 2.2, any additional, contrary or different terms
contained in any Confirmation (as defined below) or any of Philips’s invoices or other communications between the Parties, and any other

Agreement or be binding on the Parties unless such terms have been fully approved in a signed writing by authorized by both Parties.

times as a “Party” and collectively at times as the “ Parties”.
BACKGROUND

B. Buyer sells various types of products, including certain products of the type made by Seller, to its customers.
C. The Parties are entering into this Agreement to establish the terms and conditions under which Seller may agree to sell specific products to Buyer, and

AGREEMENT
1. Term. The “Term” of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will end on the earlier of: (a) the first anniversary of the expiration date of
the last Purchase Schedule (as defined in this next Section); (b) a termination date elected by a Party in a written notice delivered to the other Party any
time after the expiration of the last Purchase Schedule; or (c) a termination date elected by a Party in a written notice delivered to the other Party as
provided in Subsection 11(d) of this Agreement. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will survive the expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement with respect to any (i) products purchased and sold under this Agreement during the Term and products sold after the
Term for orders accepted during the Term; (ii) Confidential Information (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) disclosed or received by a Party

updated standard operating procedures (the “ Updated SOPs ”). Until the Parties have signed a written amendment appending the Updated SOPs, the
parties will continue to follow the Current SOPs. The Parties will comply with the applicable SOPs in connection with the purchase and sale of products
identified in a Purchase Schedule. The Parties may add terms and conditions to, and amend the terms and conditions of, the SOP in a Purchase Schedule,

identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration.
4. Order and Priority of Interpretation. In the event of any conflict, inconsistency or ambiguity between two or more provisions in this Agreement,

the following order of priority: (1st) a Purchase Schedule with regards to the purchase and sale of the specific products identified in that Purchase
Schedule for its duration; (2 nd) the SOP; (3rd) any Exhibit to this Agreement but only with regards to specific subject matter of the Exhibit; and (4 th ) the

alleged criminal misconduct or a fine in excess of $100,000 USD.
A Party will promptly notify the other Party of any change in circumstance during the Term in which the Party is no longer in compliance with the
foregoing general representations, warranties and covenants. An incident of actual, alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party with a warranty
under this Section being investigated, contested or corrected in good faith by the Party and which, regardless of outcome, will have no material adverse
effect on the Party or its performance under this Agreement or on the other Party, will not be considered a breach of this clause. An incident of actual,
alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party of this Section or any other Section of this Agreement will be grounds for the other Party to demand
adequate assurances of performance as provided by Section 2-609 of the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code. A Party will have ten (10) days to provide
adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.

d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must:

intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the
third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified

g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how
liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential
conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their
joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are
able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense
agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict
of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue
payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.

delay in performance under this Subsection for an event of Force Majeure only if the Party (1) promptly notifies the other Party of the event
of Force Majeure and provides information reasonably requested by the other Party regarding the event of Force Majeure, the efforts
undertaken by the
Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019Party to foresee and avoid interruption or delay in its performance before the occurrence of the event, to mitigate interruption or delay in
performance during the event, and to recover from and restore performance following the event; and (2) the Party exercises commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate, recover from and restore performance following the event of Force Majeure. During, and while recovering
from and restoring performance following, an event of Force Majeure, Seller will act in good faith in allocating its available manufacturing
capacity to supply products to Buyer under this Agreement and any products to other customers of Seller. If an event of Force Majeure
interrupts or delays Seller from supplying a product to Buyer under this Agreement in the quantities and timetable required by Buyer, Buyer
may cancel any unfilled orders for the product with Seller and procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources
until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure. If the interruption or delay in the
supply of a product to Buyer under this Agreement caused by an event of Force Majeure has exceeded, or is reasonably likely to exceed,
thirty (30) days, Buyer may enter into longer term supply agreements or make other arrangements to procure the required quantities of the
product from one or more other sources for a duration and on terms acceptable to Buyer in its good faith discretion. In such a circumstance,
Buyer will not have to resume purchasing the product from Seller under this Agreement until Seller has recovered from and restored its
ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure and the longer term agreements or other arrangements have expired or Buyer is able
to end them without liability. This Subsection will not excuse nor extend a deadline by which a Party must pay an amount owed under this
Agreement or Applicable Law or by which a Party must exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or Applicable Law.
10. Confidential Information and Other Intellectual Property.
a. The Parties anticipate exchanging Confidential Information (as defined in in the next Subsection) over the Term of this Agreement for the
purpose of negotiating and entering into Purchase Schedules and amendments to this Agreement, transacting business with one in
accordance with this Agreement and exercising their rights and performing their obligations under this Agreement (collectively referred to
as the “ Authorized Purpose ”).
b. The phrase “ Confidential Information” means information meeting all of the following criteria:
1) The information is a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information owned by a Party or its direct and indirect
subsidiaries under Applicable Law (this Party is referred to at times in this Section as the “ Disclosing Party ”); and
2) The other Party (referred to at times in this Section as the “ Receiving Party”) requests such information from the Disclosing
Party for the Authorized Purpose during the Term (i.e., neither Party wants unsolicited  Confidential Information from the other
Party); and
3) The Disclosing Party discloses such requested information to the Receiving Party during the Term either labelled as
“Confidential” or words of similar intent, or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the
Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure. If a Disclosing Party neglects to
label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the
disclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to
demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret
or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.
Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019The criteria in Clause (2) and Clause (3) will not apply to Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party observed or heard by a Receiving
Party in a plant, warehouse, facility or system of the Disclosing Party. The existence and terms of this Agreement, and the existence, nature
and extent of the business relationship between the Parties, will be considered the Confidential Information of each Party.
c. The phrase “ Confidential Information” also means the Know-How of a Disclosing Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries that a
Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries learned of, acquired or otherwise used prior to the Effective Date. The phrase
“Know-How” means trade secret and other confidential, proprietary information of a Party or its Affiliate concerning the manufacture,
storage, packaging, marketing, sale and delivery of its products. Examples of Know-How may be in the form of drawings, equipment
specifications, formulae, formulations, guidelines, manuals, methods, plans, policies, procedures, processes, properties and applications of
raw materials and products, tools, dies and molds. A Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries may continue to use the Know-
How of the Disclosing Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries in the possession of the Receiving Party and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries as of the Effective Date for the Authorized Purpose and in connection with the operation of the business of the Receiving Party
and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Nothing in this Subsection or any other provisions of this Agreement will obligate a Party to
disclose or license the use of its Know-How of any kind and in any form arising, discovered, acquired or developed after the Effective Date
to the other Party.
d. The phrase “ Confidential Information” does not include, and there will not be any duties of confidentiality or other restrictions under this
Agreement for, the following types of information:
(1) Information which is or becomes available as part of the public domain through any means other than as a result of a breach
of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; or
(2) Information, other than Know-How received prior the Effective Date, which is known to the Receiving Party before the
disclosure of the same information by the Disclosing Party; or
(3) Information which is or becomes available to the Receiving Party from a third-party who is not under any duty to preserve the
confidentiality of such information; or
(4) Information which is furnished by the Disclosing Party to a third-party without imposing any duty on the third-party to
preserve the confidentiality of such information; or
(5) Information which is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of or reliance on any trade secret or
other non-public, proprietary information provided by the Disclosing Party as Confidential Information under this Agreement
or under any prior agreement between the Parties; or
(6) Information that ceases to be a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party under
applicable law through any means other than those enumerated above that does not involve nor result from a breach of this
Agreement by the Receiving Party.
e. A Party may request and disclose Confidential Information in any form or medium. Confidential Information may include, without limitation,
information concerning the assets, liabilities, financing, financial statements, ownership, goods, services, customers, suppliers, marketing,
manufacturing, equipment, software, technology, supply chain, business strategies, plans, models, policies, methods, processes, formulae,
specifications, drawings, schematics, software and technical know-how of a Disclosing Party. A Receiving Party will take all commercially
reasonable actions required to safeguard the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party in the possession of such Receiving Party
against the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information by other persons. A Receiving Party will promptly notify the
Disclosing Party if the Receiving Party learns of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party
by any
Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019person. A Receiving Party will cooperate in good faith with the Disclosing Party to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of the
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any person.
f. A Receiving Party will not disclose nor use the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party except as follows:
(1) A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party on a “ need to know ” basis to the
Representatives of the Receiving Party who require such information for the Authorized Purpose and in order for the
Receiving Party and its Affiliates to comply with Applicable Laws, accounting standards and securities exchange
requirements. Before making such a disclosure, the Receiving Party will advise the Representatives of the confidential nature
of the information being shared and ensure that duties and restrictions are, or have been, imposed on the Representatives
receiving the Confidential Information similar to those imposed on the Receiving Party under this Agreement. A Receiving
Party will be liable for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives. An “ Affiliate” of a Party means a legal entity that
owns and controls, or is owned and controlled by, or is under common ownership and control with, a Party (other than the
other Party or any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries), with ownership and control of a legal entity being determined by the
ownership of the majority voting interest in the legal entity. A “ Representative ” means the Affiliates of a Party and the
directors, officers, managers, employees, accountants, attorneys, auditors and other agents and consultants of a Party and its
Affiliates.
(2) A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to a court, governmental entity or any other
person in order for the Receiving Party and its Affiliates to comply with Applicable Laws, accounting standards and securities
exchange requirements. If legally permissible and reasonably possible, a Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party prior
to disclosing its Confidential Information pursuant to this Section and cooperate in good faith with any lawful efforts by the
Disclosing Party to avoid or limit the disclosure of its Confidential Information. A Receiving Party will not be obligated to
incur any liability, expense or risk in extending such cooperation to a Disclosing Party. Based on legal advice of its attorney, a
Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any deadline established under an
Applicable Law, accounting standard and securities exchange requirement.
(3) A Receiving Party may disclose and use the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to enforce or interpret this
Agreement or any other agreement with the Disclosing Party in any arbitration, court or other legal proceeding. A Receiving
Party may disclose and use this Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to defend the Receiving Party or its Affiliates
or their respective Representatives in any arbitration, court or other legal proceeding. In either circumstance, the Receiving
Party will ensure that a protective order, agreement or other mechanism is in place to preserve the confidentiality of the
Confidential Information.
(4) A Receiving Party and its Representatives may disclose and use the Confidential Information for any other purpose
consented to by a Disclosing Party in a written notice signed by an officer of the Disclosing Party delivered to the Receiving
Party.
g. In disclosing its Confidential Information to a Receiving Party, a Disclosing Party represents, warrants and covenants to the Receiving Party
that:
(1) The Disclosing Party owns and has the right to disclose and authorize the use of Confidential Information as provided in this
Agreement.
Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019(2) The Receiving Party and its Representatives may use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for the Authorized
Purpose and other limited purposes provided in this Agreement.
(3) The Disclosing Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiving Party and its Representatives against any claim
of a third-party that the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as provided in this
Agreement infringes on a patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property of the third-party registered
in or otherwise recognized and enforceable under Applicable Laws.
Except for the limited representations and warranties in this Section, a Disclosing Party disclaims all other representations and warranties of
any kind related to its Confidential Information, whether express, implied or arising by operation of law, including the disclaimer, without
limitation, of any representation and warranties concerning merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, truth, accuracy or
completeness.
h. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Section with regards to disclosed Confidential Information will continue:
(1) Until the earlier of (i) sixty (60) months from the date of disclosure to a Receiving Party or (ii) the date such information ceases
to be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement, for Confidential Information that is not a trade secret of a
Disclosing Party under Applicable Law; and
(2) Until Confidential Information that is a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law ceases to be a trade secret of
the Disclosing Party under Applicable Law.
i. A Receiving Party will return or destroy all forms of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in the custody of the Receiving Party
and its Representatives within ten (10) days of receipt of a written request from the Disclosing Party and after the expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement. This will include, without limitation, all copies, records, documents and other information representing,
comprising, containing, referencing or created based on Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party which (x) the Receiving Party
and its Representatives are required to retain to comply with Applicable Laws, accounting standards and security exchange requirements
(but only for the duration and in the manner so required for this limited purpose); or (y) have been archived in electronic form by the
Receiving Party and its Representatives and which would be unduly burdensome for the Receiving Party and its Representatives to have to
search for and delete the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.
j. Except for the limited right to disclose and use Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose and other
purposes provided in the this Section and except for any license of intellectual property granted by a Disclosing Party to the Receiving
Party in a Purchase Schedule, this Agreement does not grant a Receiving Party or its Representatives any right, title, interest or ownership
in the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party nor in any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property of the
Disclosing Party. As between the Parties during the Term, to be effective, the grant of any right, title, interest and ownership in and to any
Confidential Information of Party or in an patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property of the Party must be in writing and
signed by the chief executive officers of the Parties. During the Term, a Party will not develop intellectual property for, on behalf of, or in
collaboration with, the other Party unless the Parties have entered into a Purchase Schedule or other separate written agreement signed by
an officer of each Party.

interpretation of this Agreement (a “ Dispute”), the Parties will endeavor to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiation for a period
of thirty (30) days after a Party notifies the other Party of the Dispute and before either Party requests mediation or files litigation to resolve
the Dispute.
b. Mediation . If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through good faith negotiation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party
may request that the Parties attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation by notifying the other Party with a copy to JAMS. The
Parties will attempt to select a mutually acceptable JAMS mediator within ten (10) days of the notice requesting mediation. The mediation
will be held in Lake County or Cook County, Illinois within thirty (30) days of the notice requesting mediation before a JAMS mediator and
in compliance with JAMS mediation guidelines. Each party will bear its own costs in preparing for and participating in the mediation and

c. Litigation.  If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through mediation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may file
litigation against the other Party in a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States of America. With respect to litigation involving
only the Parties or their Affiliates, the Parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the U.S. federal and
Illinois state courts of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Lake County, Illinois or Cook County, Illinois and their respective
higher courts of appeal for the limited purpose of resolving a Dispute, and the Parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
defense of inconvenient forum. The Parties waive any right to trial by jury as to any Disputes resolved through litigation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Party may file litigation to resolve a Dispute without undergoing either negotiation or mediation as provided in the prior

Information; or (iii) a request for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or any other type of equitable relief.
d. Remedies. Except as expressly limited in the preceding Subsections and the other provisions in this Agreement, a Party may immediately
exercise any rights and remedies available to the Party under Applicable Law upon a breach of this Agreement by the other Party. A Party
will not suspend performance under or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchased and sold
under this Agreement unless: (1) the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement and has either refused to cure the material breach or
has failed to cure the material breach within thirty (30) day of its receipt of written notice of the failure; and (2) the Parties have been unable
to resolve the Dispute related to the material breach through negotiation or mediation, or the breaching Party has refused or failed to
attempt to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation, as provided in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may
suspend performance or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchase and sold under this
Agreement immediately on written notice to the other Party, and without providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material
breach or attempting to resolve a Dispute over the material breach by negotiation or mediation as provided in this Section, for a material
breach by the other Party involving substantial harm to the reputation, goodwill and business of the non-breaching  Party that cannot
reasonably be avoided or fully redressed by providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach.
e. Late Fees and Collection Costs. If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will
owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount for each full or partial
calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid. In addition, if Seller has to file
Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019litigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated
out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount.
Under no circumstance will the late payment fee payable to Seller exceed the amount that a creditor may lawfully impose on a debtor on a
delinquent amount under Applicable Law.

a. Entire Agreement . This Agreement, including its appended Exhibits and Purchase Schedules entered into during the Term, constitutes the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the sale of products by Seller to Buyer and the purchase of products by Buyer from
Seller. This Agreement supersedes all prior and simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations, letters, proposals, agreements and
understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to this subject matter. This Agreement will not be binding on either Party unless and
until signed by the chief executive officers of each Party. No handwritten or other addition, deletion or other modification to the printed
portions of this Agreement will be binding upon either Party to this Agreement.
b. Amendments. A Party may not amend nor supplement the terms and conditions in this Agreement through the inclusion of additional or
different terms and conditions in any quotation, purchase order, invoice, bill of lading, letter, email or other document or communication.

the type and quantity of ordered products and scheduled date and location for delivery). No amendment of this Agreement will be valid or
effective unless made in writing and signed and exchanged by the chief executive officers of the Parties. A Party may approve or reject a
request for an amendment in its sole and absolute discretion.
c. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement
or to take advantage of any of its rights shall not operate as a continuing waiver of such rights.  No right or obligation under this Agreement
will be considered to have been waived by a Party unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an officer of the waiving Party and
delivered to the other Party. No consent to or waiver of a breach by either Party will constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any
other, different, or subsequent breach by such Party.
d. Governing Law . This Agreement and all claims or causes of action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Illinois and the United States of America, without

Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019notice of such assignment prior to or promptly following the effective date of such assignment. A change of control shall be deemed an
assignment requiring consent hereunder provided that any transfer or assignment that results in Seller’s and Buyer’s current common
parent, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, ceasing to control either party shall not require consent of the other party. The restrictions in this
Section will not preclude a Party for authorizing an Affiliate to purchase or sell a product on behalf of a Party under this Agreement. Subject
to the foregoing, all of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
successors and assignees of the respective Parties.
