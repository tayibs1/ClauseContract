as permitted by Applicable Laws, of withholding taxes.
6.5 Determination of Specialty.
6.5.1 No later than [***] (or in the case of the first full Calendar Quarter following the Effective Date, promptly
following the Effective Date), Dova shall provide Valeant with a list of Target Professionals in the Territory, together with their
primary and secondary specialty designation, as generated by Dova’s Third Party Data Source. Promptly following receipt by
Valeant of such list, but no later than [***] after receipt of the list of Target Professionals, Valeant may present to Dova a list of
Target Professionals that, acting in good faith, it reasonably believes have a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently
practice in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology. For greater certainty, this list may include, but not
be limited to, Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and
a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, for which Valeant wishes to confirm the primary specialty.
6.5.2 Promptly following receipt by Dova of such list from Valeant, the Parties shall meet and discuss, acting
reasonably and in good faith, such list and their appropriate primary specialty. If the parties agree that the Target Professional
included on such list has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of
Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova’s Third Party Data Source for each
such Target Professional, requesting that Dova’s Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary
specialty designation of each such Target Professional. In addition, if the Parties do not agree, but Valeant, acting reasonably and in
good faith, still believes that the Target Professional has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently
practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova’s Third
Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova’s Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to
determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. The Parties shall equally share in the incremental
costs to Dova of any such investigations by Dova’s Third Party Data Source. For greater certainty, if, under Dova’s agreement
with Dova’s Third Party Data Source, Dova is entitled to a certain number of investigations at no additional cost, and such
investigations requested by Valeant causes Dova to incur additional costs that it would not have, but for such investigations
requested by Valeant, then Valeant shall still be required to share in any costs of investigations (pursuant to Dova’s Third Party
Data Source’s standard rates) that would otherwise be a no-cost investigations. In the event that Dova incurs costs for which
Valeant is responsible under this Section 6.5, Dova may deduct such amounts from the payments due under Section 6.3 and shall
include a description thereof in the applicable report under Section 6.3.
6.5.3 In the event that Dova’s Third Party Data Source agrees to conduct such investigation, and then based on
the results of such investigation, Dova’s Third Party Data Source changes the primary designation of the Target Professional to
Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology or, in the case of those Target Professionals with a primary specialty
designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, confirms
that the primary specialty designation should remain Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then, commencing with
the Calendar Quarter in which such investigations were conducted, such Target Professionals shall be deemed to be in the
Specialty (regardless of whether their secondary specialty designation remains or becomes Hepatology). In the event that,
following such investigation, Dova’s Third Party Data source does not change the primary specialty designation to
Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology or, in the case of those Target Professionals with a primary specialty
designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, changes
the primary specialty designation to a specialty other than Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then those Target
Professionals shall be deemed not to be in the Specialty. For those Target Professionals that were not the subject of an inquiry to
or an investigation by Dova’s Third Party Data Source, then the specialty designations set out in the original list generated by
Dova’s Third Party Data Source shall apply for such Calendar Quarter, namely those Target Professionals that have either a
Source: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018primary or a secondary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and that do not have either a
primary or a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology shall be deemed to be in the Specialty.
6.5.4 The process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated for each Calendar Quarter of the Term;
provided, however, that, pursuant to the process described above, if Dova’s Third Party Data Source has confirmed that a Target
Professional’s primary specialty designation should be or should remain Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, it is
not necessary for Valeant to seek this confirmation in subsequent Calendar Quarters; provided, further, that, if Dova’s Third Party
Data Source is subsequently updated (by Dova or any Third Party) to change the specialty designation (primary or secondary) of a
Target Professional, pursuant to a request by Dova or a Third Party, then the process described in this Section 6.5 shall be
repeated with respect to such Target Professional.

Dova, shall be deemed Valeant Property. [***], Valeant hereby grants to Dova a fully paid-up, royalty free, non-transferable, non-

contained in the Product materials or Product Labeling solely for use in connection with Dova’s promotion or other
commercialization of the Product in the Territory.

does assign, to Dova (and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective employees and other representatives to assign to
Dova) any and all right, title and interest that Valeant (or any such Affiliates, employees or other representatives) may have in or to
any Invention. For clarity, any and all Inventions and any information contained therein or related thereto shall constitute
Confidential Information of Dova.

Copyrights shall at all times vest in and inure to the benefit of Dova, and Valeant shall assign, and hereby does assign, any rights it

obligation), as determined by Dova in its sole discretion, to (i) maintain the Dova Trademarks and Copyrights and/or (ii) protect,
enforce and defend the Dova Trademarks and Copyrights. Valeant shall give notice to Dova of any infringement of, or challenge to,

shall reasonably cooperate with Dova, at Dova’s cost and expense. Any recovery obtained by Dova as a result of such proceeding
or other actions, whether obtained by settlement or otherwise, shall be retained by Dova. Valeant shall not have any right to
institute any action to defend or enforce the Dova Trademarks and Copyrights.

property by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, and as between the Parties, all ownership rights therein shall remain with the

Agreement and the disclosing Party shall be liable for any failures of such disclosees to abide by such obligations of confidentiality
and non-use; or
(c) such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with Applicable Laws, including regulations
promulgated by applicable securities exchanges, court order, administrative subpoena or order.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Party is required to make a disclosure of the other Party’s
Confidential Information pursuant to Section 9.1.2(a) or 9.1.2(c), such Party shall, if permitted, promptly notify the other Party of
such required disclosure and shall use reasonable efforts to assist the other Party (at the other Party’s cost) in obtaining, a
protective order preventing or limiting the required disclosure.
9.2 Public Announcements. The press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A. No public announcement or statements (including presentations to investor meetings and customer

have the right to make any such public announcement or other disclosure required by Applicable Law after such Party has
provided to the other Party a copy of such announcement or disclosure and an opportunity to comment thereon and the disclosing
Party shall reasonably consider the other Party’s comments. Each Party agrees that it shall cooperate fully with the other with
respect to all disclosures regarding this Agreement to the Securities Exchange Commission and any other Governmental
Authorities, including requests for confidential treatment of proprietary information of either Party included in any such disclosure.
Once any written statement is approved for disclosure by the Parties or information is otherwise made public in accordance with
this Section 9.2, either Party may make a subsequent public disclosure of the same contents of such statement in the same context
as such statement without further approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event shall either Party disclose any financial information of the other without the prior written consent of such other Party, unless
such financial information already has been publicly disclosed by the Party owning the financial information or otherwise has been
made part of the public domain by no breach of a Party of its obligations under this ARTICLE 9.

respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns from and against all Claims, and all
associated Losses, to the extent incurred or suffered by any of them to the extent resulting from or arising out of (a) any
misrepresentation or breach of any representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of Dova under this Agreement, (b) the
negligence, willful misconduct or violation of Applicable Laws by Dova (or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective officers,

11.2 Indemnification by Valeant. Valeant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dova and its Affiliates and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns from and against all Claims and all

misrepresentation or breach of any representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of Valeant under this Agreement, or (b)
the negligence, willful misconduct, or violation of Applicable Laws by Valeant (or any of its Affiliates or its and their respective
Source: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives); except in each case to the extent any such Claims, and all associated
Losses, are caused by an item for which Dova is obligated to indemnify Valeant pursuant to Section 11.1.

“Indemnified Party”) shall give prompt notice to the Party against whom indemnity is sought (the “Indemnifying Party”) of the
assertion or commencement of any Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable,
and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.
The failure to give such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense and settlement of any
such action, suit or proceeding at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate
in all reasonable respects in such defense, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense. The Indemnified Party will be entitled at its own
expense to participate in such defense and to employ separate counsel for such purpose. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is
diligently defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable under Section 11.1 or
11.2, as applicable, for any settlement effected without its consent. No Party shall enter into any compromise or settlement which
commits the other Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action without the other Party’s prior written consent (and unless such
compromise or settlement includes no payments by the Indemnified Party, an unconditional release of, and no admission of liability
by, the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim).

ITS AFFILIATES THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH A
BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHERWISE, AND REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE
FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE
OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE,
OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY’S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE
OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.
11.5 Insurance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self-
insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to
cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly
situated. Each Party shall provide reasonable written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other Party upon request.
Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker’s compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any
Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant’s sole responsibility. For clarity, the insurance requirements of this Section 11.5
shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE
11.

Joint Press Release
DURHAM, N.C. and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Sept. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Dova”)
(DOVA), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseases
where there is a high unmet need, and Salix Pharmaceuticals (“Salix”), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the
world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, Bausch Health Companies
Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC), today announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote Dova’s
DOPTELET (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved
DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are
scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the
United States for this indication.
Thrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in
patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5
million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe
thrombocytopenia (<75,000/µL) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased
rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as
liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.
As part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote
DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October
2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other
specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of
DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.
“We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in
the United States,” said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. “Given Salix’s presence and
strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the
gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.”
“Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN® (rifaximin),
an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of
chronic liver disease,” said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. “Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable
our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.”

Source: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018About DOPTELET 
DOPTELET (avatrombopag) is a second generation, once daily, orally administered TPO receptor agonist approved for the
treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with CLD who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET is designed to
mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.
Two global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults
with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/µL) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to
either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/µmL or
<40,000/µmL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not
requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in
both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs.
23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two
secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients
achieving the target platelet count of ≥50,000/µmL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count
from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each
secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with
avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have
been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein
thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.
INDICATION
DOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who
are scheduled to undergo a procedure.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
DOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and
thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with
chronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment-
emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with
DOPTELET.
Consider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for
thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or
Protein C or S deficiency).
DOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.
CONTRAINDICATIONS: None

About XIFAXAN 
XIFAXAN is a nonsystemic* antibiotic that slows the growth of bacteria in the gut that are believed to be linked to symptoms of
overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE). It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations
in adults.
*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be
exercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.
INDICATION 
XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in
adults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
•XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin
antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.
•If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C.
difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare
provider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.
•Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause
increased effects of the medicine.
•Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine)
because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.
•In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were:
HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue
(feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen) 
IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes
•XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the
dose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.
•If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because
XIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-
FDA-1088.

Note that this authorisation may be revoked at any time and Distributor shall then include the 6 months flag again in future builds.  
 
 
- 22 -EXHIBIT C   Guidelines for Applications Bundled with Google Applications   Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called “drive-by download”), inundating end users with advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent, obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user’s ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.   Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to Google’s business.   With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not, bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.   For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.   In these Guidelines: (a) “you” and “your” refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) “Application” means any application, plug-in, helper, component or other executable code that runs on a user’s computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging, chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.  Google Confidential   
 
 
- 23 -Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.   If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.   Google Confidential  
 
 
- 24 -1. General.   1.1 Approval and Ongoing Compliance. You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1) has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google’s approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a written request.   1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.   2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to “hacking” or “cracking.”   3. Prohibited Behavior. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that engages in deceptive, unfair, harassing or otherwise annoying practices. For example, the Application may not:   
  
  
  
  Google Confidential  
 
  (a) use, or permit an unaffiliated person to use, an end user’s computer system for any purpose not understood and affirmatively consented to by the end user (including, without limitation, for purposes of consuming bandwidth or computer resources, sending email messages, launching denial of service attacks, accruing toll charges through a dialer or obtaining personal information from an end user’s computer such as login, password, account or other information personal to the end user); 
  (b) intentionally create or exploit any security vulnerabilities in end user computers; 
  (c) trigger pop-ups, pop-unders, exit windows, or similar obstructive or intrusive functionality, that materially interfere with an end user’s Web navigation or browsing or the use of his or her computer; 
  (d) repeatedly ask an end user to take, or try to deceive an end user into taking, an action that the end user has previously declined to take (such as repeatedly asking an end user to change his or her home page or some other setting or configuration); 
 
- 25 -4. Disclosure and Consent.   4.1 Disclosure and Consent before Installation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless you (and your distribution and bundling partners, if applicable under the terms of the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines) design the installation of any such Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner - e.g., no “drive-by’ downloads or installs. By “distribution partner” we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by “bundling partner” we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:   
  
  
  
  
  4.2 Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable information. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2) collects or transmits information related to a user’s computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user’s personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the first occurrence of any such collection or transmission you:   
  Google Confidential  
 
  (e) redirect browser traffic away from valid DNS entries (except that your Application may direct unresolved URLs to an alternative URL designated by you, provided that the page to which the end user resolves adequately informs the end user that you and your Application are the source of that page); 
  (f) interfere with the browser default search functionality (except that your Application may permit an end user to change his or her default search engine with proper disclosure, consent and attribution as provided below); or 
  (g) engage in activity that violates any applicable Jaw or regulation. 
  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users: 
  (i) that they are installing an application, 
  (ii) the name of the Application, identifying you as the entity responsible for it, and 
  (iii) the principal and significant features and functionality of the Application; and 
  (b) then, obtain the end user’s affirmative consent to install the Application. 
  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose: 
 
- 26 -4.3 Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that makes a change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (e.g., changing the browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application), unless prior to making such change you:   
  
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu, and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the end user.   4.4 Method of Disclosure and Consent. In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom) and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.   4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user’s use of his or her computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must be disclosed in your privacy policy.   Google Confidential  
 
  (i) the type of information collected (described with specificity in the case of personally identifiable information), 
  (ii) the method of collection (e.g. by registration, etc.), and 
  (iii) the location of (i.e., a link to) the privacy policy that governs the collection, use and disclosure of the information; and 
  (b) then, obtain the end user’s affirmative consent to such collection and/or transmission. 
  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose the change in a manner that will explain the practical effect of such change; and 
  (b) then, obtain the end user’s affirmative consent to make such change. 
 
- 27 -5. Transparency. Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously disclosed to end users.   6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user’s ability to change any preferences or settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re-enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent practicable.   7. Bundling of Applications. In addition to the requirements set forth in the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines, in order for you to bundle any Application with a Google Application must satisfy each of the following requirements:   
  
  
  Google Confidential  
 
  (a) the end user is made aware of all of the Applications included in the bundle prior to any installation; 
  (b) all such Applications included in the bundle or download comply with the provisions of Section 2 through 6 of these Guidelines; 
  (c) if Applications in a bundle in which you are participating are supported in part by revenue generated by advertising displayed in another independent Application included in that bundle and the continued use of the Application is conditioned on such other independent Application remaining installed and active on the end user’s computer, the end user must be made aware of that relationship; and 
 
- 28 -8. Information and Assistance. Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example, we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would include providing Google with “golden masters” of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand, however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.   9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must also obtain Google’s written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines. Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.   10. Updates.   10.1 General. As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time; provided, however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with thirty (30) days’ written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice (the date on which you receive such notice, the “Update Notice Date”), you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within thirty (30) days   Google Confidential  
 
  (d) either (1) the bundle must provide for a master uninstaller that will enable the end user to uninstall every Application in the bundle without undue effort or skill, or (2) if no master uninstaller is provided, the de-installation of any Application may not be dependent or conditioned upon the de-installation of any other Application included in the bundle. 
 
- 29 -10.2 Extended Compliance Period. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of such update (the “Update Effective Date”), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the “Maximum Compliance Period”). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.   Google Confidential

expense, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out Pfizer’s responsibilities under the Annual Marketing Plan, which
commercially reasonable efforts shall include committing the appropriate resources to assist in the implementation of the Annual

Year subject to, (a) Exact spending at least twelve million dollars ($12,000,000) in Baseline M&P Expense each Calendar Quarter
(provided , that notwithstanding Exact’s quarterly spend for Baseline M&P Expense, Exact shall spend a total of eighty million

adjusted pro rata based on the number of months remaining until the end of the Calendar Year. For Calendar Year 2018, Pfizer’s
Shared M&P Expense shall be adjusted to equal the number of months remaining from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018
divided by twelve (12) multiplied by twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000); provided  the requirements of this Section 3.5 are
satisfied. Pfizer shall have no obligation to incur Shared M&P Expenses in excess of the amount in the above chart for the given
Calendar Year, unless the Parties mutually agree to increase their portion of the Shared M&P Expense.
3.6 Exact Investment and Support. Exact shall commit, at its sole cost and expense and not subject to reimbursement by Pfizer, to

Expense”). In addition to Baseline M&P Expense, Exact shall invest Shared M&P Expense in amounts to be matched by Pfizer
pursuant to Section 3.5 above. Exact, at its own expense, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to carry out Exact’s
responsibilities under the Annual Marketing Plan, which commercially reasonable efforts shall include committing the appropriate

Calendar Year 2018, Exact’s Baseline M&P Expense and Shared M&P Expense shall be adjusted to equal the number of months
remaining from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018 divided by twelve (12) multiplied by eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) or
twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000), as applicable; provided  that the requirements of this Section 3.6 are satisfied. Exact
shall have no obligation to incur Shared M&P Expenses in excess of the amount in the above chart for the given Calendar Year,
unless the Parties each agree to increase their portion of the Shared M&P Expense.
3.7 Changes in Shared M&P Expenses. In the event the Parties agree to not implement or to discontinue implementation of a strategy or
tactic included in any Annual Marketing Plan, the applicable Shared M&P Expense investment set forth above shall be either (a)
adjusted if, during good faith discussions at the JSC, the Parties agree on the implementation of a substitute strategy or tactic in
place of the strategy or tactic that was not implemented or was discontinued, which adjustment will reflect any difference in cost
of such substitute strategy or tactic or (b) reduced by the amount(s) allocated in the applicable budget for such strategy or tactic
under the applicable Annual Marketing Plan, if the Parties, during good faith discussions at the JSC, agree not to implement a
substitute strategy or tactic in place of the strategy or tactic that was not implemented or which was discontinued. Any amount
saved as result of this Section 3.7 shall be re-deployed to other expenses associated with the Marketing of the Product, unless
otherwise determined by the JSC.
4. ACCOUNTING.
4.1 Responsibility for Shared M&P Expenses.
(a) General. Shared M&P Expenses contributed by Exact and Pfizer pursuant to Sections 3.5 and 3.6 shall be used solely to fund
activities pursuant to the Annual Marketing Plan. The Parties shall agree to Calendar Quarter phasing of Baseline M&P
Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses for budgeting purposes. The Parties will spend amounts contributed to Baseline
M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses simultaneously throughout each Calendar Year, in a manner consistent with
the approved budget set forth in the Annual Marketing Plan. Any Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses
budgeted but not spent in Calendar Quarter may be rolled over into the next Calendar Quarter. For the avoidance of
doubt, Pfizer will match dollar for dollar Exact’s Shared M&P Expense for a Calendar Year to up to the amounts set forth
in Section 3.5.
(b) Remainder of 2018. Promptly after the Effective Date, Exact shall discuss with Pfizer its planned Marketing and Promotional
spend associated with the Product for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018, so
that Pfizer may understand and recommend
30
Source: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018reallocation of all or any portion of such planned Marketing and Promotional spend associated with the Product. Budget
phasing of 2018 pro-rated Baseline M&P Expenses and pro-rated Shared M&P Expenses shall be done on the Calendar
Quarter basis. Exact agrees it shall spend at least eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) toward Marketing and Promotion
(including any amounts spent between January 1, 2018 and the Effective Date) and the pro-rated Shared M&P Expense
for 2018.
(c) Reporting. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of each month during the Term beginning with October, 2018, Exact
shall provide to Pfizer a written report setting forth the amount of Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses
incurred and paid for by Exact during such month, which report shall also provide sufficient itemization and detail related
to such expenses in order for Pfizer to confirm that such Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses were
incurred pursuant to the Annual Marketing Plan. Pfizer, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of each month
during the Term, beginning with October, 2018, shall prepare and provide to Exact a written report setting forth the
aggregate amount of Shared M&P Expenses incurred and paid for by Pfizer during such month, along with sufficient
itemization and detail related to such expenses in order for Exact to confirm that such Shared M&P Expenses were
incurred pursuant to the Annual Marketing Plan.
4.2 Promotion Fee.
(a) Calculation of Promotion Fee. From the Launch Date and ending on the last day of the next Calendar Quarter and each
subsequent Calendar Quarter during the Term, Exact shall owe Pfizer a service fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
product of: Laboratory Service Revenue minus Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue (“ Incremental Laboratory Service
Revenue”) for the Calendar Quarter multiplied by Gross Margin Percent for the Calendar Quarter (such product, the
“Promotion Fee”). In no event shall the Gross Margin Percent used in the calculation of the Promotion Fee be less than
sixty-eight percent (68%) or more than seventy-four percent (74%). The calculation of the Promotion Fee pursuant to
this Section 4.2(a) is subject to Section 4.2(c) below. Promotion Fee(s) and all compensation paid by Exact to Pfizer under
this Agreement, even where calculated as a percentage of sales, is intended to compensate Pfizer a fair market value for
the entirety of services that Pfizer is providing to Exact hereunder.
The formula for the calculation of the Promotion Fee is as follows:
A = Laboratory Service Revenue
B = Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue
C = Gross Margin Percent
Promotion Fee = 0.5 * (A-B) * C
31
Source: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018(b) Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue. The chart below sets forth the Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue for the Product
for each Calendar Year during the Term (the “Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue”). In the Annual
Marketing Plan the appropriate Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue shall be allocated among each
Calendar Quarter during such Calendar Year, taking into consideration seasonality or other sales demand variables. For
2018, the first Calendar Quarter shall be from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018 and the Calendar Year Baseline
Laboratory Service Revenue allocated to that Calendar Quarter shall be $130 million.

Revenue
2018 $441 million
2019 $622 million

2021 $1.191 billion
(c) Supplemental Promotion Fee.
(i) Subject to Pfizer’s compliance with Sections 3.4(a)(i) and 3.4(a)(ii), (A) Exact shall pay Pfizer the amount, if any, by
which the aggregate amount of the Promotion Fee incurred by Exact to Pfizer during the remainder of 2018
Calendar Year and 2019 Calendar Year (the “First Promotion Fee Period”) is less than $37.5 million (the “First
Supplemental Promotion Fee”), and (B) Exact shall pay Pfizer the amount, if any, by which the aggregate
Promotion Fee incurred by Exact to Pfizer during each of Calendar Year 2020 and 2021 is less than $30 million
(“Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee”), in each case to compensate Pfizer for the sales, Marketing and other
performance provided by Pfizer under this Agreement.
(ii) As of June 30 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate a partial-period amount to be paid toward
the potential First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the potential Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the
case may be. With regard to the First Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be equal to
the amount by which the Promotion Fee for 2018, and the first six (6) months of Calendar Year 2019, is less than
$22.5 million, and with regard to each Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be
equal to the amount by which the Promotion Fee for the six-month (6-month) period through June 30 is less
than $15 million.
(iii) As of December 31 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate the First Supplemental Promotion Fee
or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, for the entirety of the applicable period.
Exact shall pay Pfizer the First
32
Source: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018Supplemental Promotion Fee or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, less any
partial-period payment made by Exact during the applicable period pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii).
(iv) To the extent the amount of the Promotion Fee for the First Promotion Fee Period exceeds the First Supplemental
Promotion Fee, Exact shall be entitled to a credit of such excess amount up to the amount of any partial-period
payment made by Exact during such First Promotion Fee Period pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii), and Exact shall
apply such credit toward the Promotion Fee payment due Pfizer for the fourth Calendar Quarter of 2019 (or due
for subsequent Calendar Quarters until such credit is fully exhausted). To the extent the amount of the
Promotion Fee for any Calendar Year after 2019 exceeds the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee for such
Calendar Year, Exact shall be entitled to a credit of such excess amount up to the amount of any partial-period
payment made by Exact during such Calendar Year pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii), and Exact shall apply such
credit toward the Promotion Fee payment due Pfizer for the fourth Calendar Quarter of such Calendar Year (or
due for subsequent Calendar Quarters until such credit is fully exhausted).
(v) Any amounts due under Sections 4.2(c)(i) and (ii) shall be payable within thirty (30) days after each of June 30 , and
December 31  of each Calendar Year, beginning with June 30, 2019, as applicable.
(d) OB/Gyn Sales. If Exact (i) grants OB/Gyn Commercial Rights to a Third Party in accordance with Section 3.1(c) or (ii) launches
its own sales channel in the OB/Gyn Field (as applicable, the “ Excluded Channel”), then the Laboratory Service
Revenue used to perform the calculation set forth in Section 4.2(a) and to determine royalty payments pursuant to
Section 8.7 shall exclude all Laboratory Service Revenue attributable to the Excluded Channel except a mutually agreed
percentage of Laboratory Service Revenue during the applicable period attributable to such Excluded Channel (the
“Included Revenue Percentage”); provided , that (A) such Included Revenue Percentage will reflect the anticipated
relative contribution of the Parties with regard to the Excluded Channel after such launch, and (B) the Included Revenue
Percentage shall not be less than the revenue percentage attributable to the OB/Gyn Field as of the date of such launch,
calculated on the same basis that revenue from the OB/Gyn Field is calculated by Exact on the Effective Date.
4.3 Fee Statements and Payments.
(a) Monthly and Quarterly Financial Deliverables. Exact shall on a monthly basis, not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
the end of the month, deliver to Pfizer a full suite of performance data, including Product Laboratory Services completed,
average selling price per unit, Laboratory Service Revenue, rebates, net revenue and a detailed Cost of Sales schedule

costs). Not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the Calendar Quarter, Exact shall deliver to Pfizer a
rolling sales forecast and an estimate, for the remaining Calendar Quarters in the Calendar Year, of the Promotion Fee as
set forth in Section 4.2.
(b) Payment of Promotion Fee. Exact, within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter of the Term, shall deliver to
Pfizer a consolidated report in the form of and containing the information necessary to confirm the calculation of the
Promotion Fee for such Calendar Quarter, together with the underlying spreadsheets with respect to such Calendar
Quarter. The Promotion Fee due with respect to such Calendar Quarter and reflected on the consolidated report shall be
remitted at the time such report is made.
4.4 Taxes and Withholding. It is understood and agreed between the Parties that any payments made under this Agreement are exclusive
of any value added or similar tax (“VAT”), and that no such VAT shall apply to the payments made under this Agreement. In the
event any payments made pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the laws or regulation of any
jurisdiction, the Party making such payment shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of the payee to
the extent required by Applicable Law and such amounts payable to the payee shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted
and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under Applicable Law to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and
borne solely by, the payee. To the extent that the Party making a payment is required to deduct and withhold taxes on any
payments under this Agreement, the Party making such payment shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental
Authority in a timely manner and promptly transmit to the payee an official tax certificate or other evidence of such withholding
sufficient to enable the payee to claim such payments of taxes. The payee shall provide any tax forms to the Party making such
payment that may be reasonably necessary in order for such Party not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under
an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. The payee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any such tax forms to the
Party making the payment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for any payments for which the payee desires that the
Party making the payment apply a reduced withholding rate. Each Party shall provide the other with reasonable assistance to
enable the recovery, as permitted by Law, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations resulting from payments made under
this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of the Party bearing such withholding tax or VAT. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) if an action (including any assignment or sublicense of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, or any failure to comply with Applicable Law or filing or record retention requirements) by a Party leads to the
imposition of withholding tax liability or VAT on the other Party that would not have been imposed in the absence of such action
or in an increase in such liability above the liability that would have been imposed in the absence of such action, then the sum
payable by that Party (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be increased to the extent
necessary to ensure that the other Party
34
Source: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018receives a sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no such action occurred, (b) otherwise, the sum payable by
that Party (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be made to the other Party after
deduction of the amount required to be so deducted or withheld, which deducted or withheld amount shall be remitted in
accordance with Applicable Law.
4.5 No Partnership Provision. It is expressly agreed that Pfizer and Exact shall be independent contractors and that the relationship
between Pfizer and Exact shall not constitute a partnership, joint venture or agency. The Parties agree that the rights and
obligations under this Agreement are not intended to constitute a partnership or similar arrangement that will require separate
reporting for tax purposes consistent with the intent reflected in the foregoing sentence and agree that they shall not file any
reports, documents or other item relating to taxes or state or acknowledge to any tax authority that such relationship is a
partnership or similar arrangement unless required by Applicable Law.
4.6 Payments; Currency. All payments due by one Party to the other Party hereunder shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately
available funds from the account or accounts of a Party and/or its Affiliates to an account or accounts of the receiving Party
and/or its Affiliates designated in writing by the receiving Party. All amounts payable and calculations hereunder shall be in
United States dollars.
4.7 Maintenance of Records; Audits.

a period of at least three (3) years after the end of the Calendar Year to which they pertain.

Exact shall pay to Pfizer an amount equal to the actual Promotion Fee due minus the Promotion Fee paid within
thirty (30) days of the date Exact receives such accountant’s written report so concluding. If such accounting
firm correctly concludes that Promotion Fees paid to Pfizer were in excess of the amount properly due, Pfizer

negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Pfizer Indemnitee.
(b) Indemnification by Pfizer. Pfizer shall indemnify, defend and hold Exact, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the
“Exact Indemnitees”), harmless from any Claims of a Third Party, to the extent arising out of (i) any breach by Pfizer of
any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any negligent or wrongful act or

obligations under this Agreement, or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Exact Indemnitee; provided  that
in no event shall Pfizer have any obligation to indemnify Exact for any product liability claim arising out of bodily injury
or death arising from the use of the Product.
(c) Procedure.
(i) A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 6.1 (an “ Indemnified Party”) shall give prompt
written notification to the other Party (the “ Indemnifying Party”) of the commencement of any Claim by a Third
Party for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third
Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a
Third Party Claim as provided
44
Source: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018in this Section 6.1(c) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this
Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure to give notice). Within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying
Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for
indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under
Section 6.1, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.
(ii) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at its own expense; provided  that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from
counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith.
(iii) The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof
and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto.
(iv) The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any
settlement of such Claim or consent to any judgment in respect thereof that does not include a complete and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability
or obligation on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
6.2 Insurance Requirements. Each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term and for five (5) years after the Term, commercial
general liability insurance, including products liability insurance, with minimum “A-” AM Best rated insurance carriers, in each
case with limits of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate. All deductibles/retentions

liability and products liability policies, and be provided with a waiver of subrogation. To the extent of its culpability, all coverages
of Exact will be primary and non-contributing with any similar insurance carried by Pfizer. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section 6.2 to the contrary, Pfizer may meet its obligations under this Section 6.2 through self-insurance.

All costs incurred by DD to deploy its services to promote MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers will be the responsibility of DD, except as provided in Section 6.  
Section 5 — Up-Front Payment, Deposit and Promotion Fees  
5.1. MBRK will pay DD an Up-Front Payment of $50,000 upon execution of this Agreement.  
5.2. Additionally, MBRK shall pay a Deposit to DD equal to $100,000 upon the Promotion Commencement Date. Each month the Parties will review the amount of the Deposit and where necessary MBRK will make an additional deposit payment to DD in order to maintain a total Deposit with DD of at least two (2) times the current month’s Promotion Fees. For example, if in a month Promotion Fees are $105,000, then MBRK will increase the Deposit to two (2) times $105,000, equal to $210,000. The Parties agree to meet via conference call within five (5) business days of the end of each month to determine the necessary adjustment, if any, to the Deposit. If it is determined that the Deposit must be increased, within ten (10) business days of the date upon which the new Deposit is determined, MBRK shall send to DD the funds necessary to increase the Deposit. Notwithstanding the above, if during years 2 and 3 of this Agreement, in the event MBRK’s then current annual form 10-K filed with the SEC does not contain an audit opinion that expresses doubt about MBRK’s ability to continue as a going concern, then MBRK’s requirement to maintain a Deposit is waived. In all cases the Deposit amount will be used to settle any outstanding amounts due to DD by MBRK at the end of the Agreement or at the time the Deposit requirement is waived.  
5.3. Additionally, on or before the last day of each month, DD will invoice MBRK for the Promotion Fees due for the prior month. Such Promotion Fees shall be calculated by:  
(a) the following formula for the period from the Effective Date through September 30, 2010:  
For example: if during the month of March 2010 (a) (A) above was 2,000 TRx and (B) above was $36.50 then MBRK would be remit $36,500.00 to DD.  
OR  
(b) the following formula for the period from October 1, 2010 through termination of this Agreement:  
  (A) the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by: 
 
  (B) the applicable Gross Margin Per TRx multiplied by: 
 
  (C) 50%. 
  (A) the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx Tablets for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by: 
 
  (B) the applicable Gross Margin Per Tablet multiplied by: 
 
  (C) 50%.For example: if during the month of November 2010:  
MBRK would remit $89,425.00 to DD:  
These Promotion Fees represent fair market value payment for such services rendered.  
The Parties recognize that Promotion Fees are to be settled on a monthly basis which requires the use of an estimated Gross Margin Per Tablet amount until the actual Gross Margin Per Tablet for an applicable quarter can be determined. Accordingly, to facilitate the calculation and settlement of monthly Promotion Fees for periods after September 2010, the Parties agree that the Gross Margin Per Tablet used to settle the monthly Promotion Fees will be that as calculated using the previous calendar quarter’s Gross Margin Per Tablet data and current period’s Actual DD Target SegmentMOXATAG TRx. Such Promotion Fees for the three months in any calendar quarter will be subject to a true-up process which will occur by the 15th of the second month of the following quarter. By way of example, Promotion Fees for each of the months of April, May and June will be settled using the Gross Margin Per Tablet amount that has been calculated for the quarter ended March 31 and will be subject to a true-up process to occur by August 15 with any adjustment to such Promotion Fees being settled between the parties within 15 days thereafter.  
5.4 In the event MBRK shall discontinue detailing prescribers in a territory that is not included in the then current DD Target Segment Prescribers set forth in EXHIBIT 1 to this Agreement or any amendments thereto (“New DD Target Segment Prescribers”), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the Promotion Fee payable to DD should MBRK desire that DD add those New DD Target Segment Prescribers to the DD Target Segment Prescribers.  
5.5. The Promotion Fees shall be paid to DD by MBRK fifteen (15) days after the receipt of an invoice from DD by MBRK.  
5. 6. The basis for determining the Promotion Fees will be the Prescriber Data provided by MBRK to DD.  
5.7. DD agrees to submit invoices to MBRK at the following address:  
Attn: Accounts Payable MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 7 Village Circle, Suite 100 Westlake, TX 76262  
  (A)=  Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx (5,000) x an average tablet amount for the month of (9.8 tablets)= 49,000

Section 13.1 Combination Products.
(a) Depomed agrees to grant and hereby grants to King an exclusive option (exercisable at King’s sole discretion by providing written notice of intent at any time, but in
no event later than 180 days after the Effective Date) to obtain an exclusive license in the Territory to certain of Depomed’s proprietary drug delivery technology in
combination with both metformin hydrochloride and any other active pharmaceutical ingredients (a “ Combination Product License”). If King notifies Depomed in
writing within 180 days after the Effective Date that King desires to exercise its option to obtain a Combination Product License, King and Depomed shall promptly
commence good-faith negotiations regarding a definitive agreement providing for the Combination Product License, for a period of 60 days or such longer period as
may be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing; and it is agreed that, as part of such good faith negotiations, the parties will discuss, for inclusion in any
definitive agreement, appropriate non-compete obligations for each party with respect to any product containing metformin hydrochloride as an active pharmaceutical
ingredient. If Depomed and King fail to enter into such a definitive agreement during such period, then Depomed shall thereafter have the right to negotiate and enter
into one or more agreements with Third Parties related to Depomed’s proprietary drug delivery technology in combination with both metformin hydrochloride and other
active pharmaceutical ingredients; provided that, for a period of 6 months, any such agreement may not be on terms and conditions materially more favorable to the
Third Party than the terms and conditions last offered by King prior to the termination of discussions with Depomed.
(b) In the event the parties are not able to enter a definitive agreement with respect to a Combination Product License, pursuant to Section 13.1(a), then prior to the
expiration or termination of this Agreement, except pursuant to this Agreement, (i) neither party, nor any
Portions of this Exhibit were omitted and have been filed separately with the Secretary of the Commission pursuant to the Company’s
application requesting confidential treatment under Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
42Person controlled by a party, will be entitled to commercially launch in the Territory (either directly or indirectly through a marketing partner) a product containing
metformin as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, and (ii) no Affiliate of Depomed will be entitled to commercially launch in the Territory (either directly or indirectly
through a marketing partner) a product that (A) contains metformin as an active pharmaceutical ingredient and (B) uses Depomed’s or its Affiliate’s proprietary drug
delivery technology currently referred to as the AcuForm technology and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,340,475 and 6,635,280.
Section 13.2 Right of First Negotiation. Depomed shall notify King in writing in the event that Depomed desires to divest itself of its rights to the Product in the
Territory (e.g., by asset sale or product license to a Third Party), or of its rights in the Territory to a product owned or controlled by Depomed containing metformin and
another active pharmaceutical ingredient in combination with Depomed’s proprietary drug delivery technology incorporated within the Product (currently referred to as
the AcuForm technology) (a “Combination Product”). If King notifies Depomed in writing within 30 days after receipt of such notice (the “Evaluation Period”) that King
is not interested in obtaining all of Depomed’s rights in and to the Product or the applicable Combination Product (such rights, “ Metformin Product Rights”), or if King
fails to notify Depomed of King’s interest in obtaining the Metformin Product Rights, in either case prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, then Depomed shall
have no further obligation to King under this Agreement with respect to the applicable Metformin Product Rights. If King is interested in obtaining the Metformin
Product Rights, it shall so notify Depomed in writing prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, and upon Depomed’s receipt of such notice King and Depomed
shall promptly commence good-faith negotiations, for a period of 30 days and such longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing in the event
the parties have made material progress in the negotiations (the “ Negotiation Period”), regarding the commercially reasonable terms of an agreement pursuant to which
King shall obtain the Metformin Product Rights. If Depomed and King fail to enter into an agreement for the Metformin Product Rights prior to the expiration of the
Negotiation Period, then Depomed shall thereafter have the right to negotiate and enter into an agreement with a Third Party granting the Metformin Product Rights to a
Third Party; provided that, for a period of 6 months, any such agreement may not be on terms and conditions materially more favorable to the Third Party than the terms
and conditions last offered by King prior to the termination of discussions with Depomed. The provisions of this Section 13.2 shall not apply to, and Depomed shall
have no obligation to King under this Section 13.2 in respect of, any acquisition of Depomed by a Third Party, any merger or consolidation with or involving Depomed,
any acquisition by a Third Party of any material portion of the stock of Depomed, or any acquisition by a Third Party of a material portion of the assets of Depomed in
addition to the Product or any Combination Product; provided that such Third Party must remain bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this
Section 13.2.

the scope or extent of this Agreement or any of its terms or conditions and therefore shall not be considered in the interpretation, construction or application of this
Agreement.
Section 16.2 Severability. In the event that any of the provisions or a portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a governmental authority, such provision or portion of provision will be construed and enforced as if it had been narrowly drawn so
as not to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, and the validity, legality, and enforceability of the enforceable portion of any such provision and the remaining provisions
will not be adversely affected thereby.
Section 16.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the schedules and exhibits hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which are incorporated by
reference, contains all of the terms agreed to by the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements, understandings, or arrangements

does not constitute, and will not be construed as, a waiver of such term or right, and will in no way affect that party’s right later to enforce or exercise such term or right.
Section 16.7 Force Majeure.

this Agreement and have contributed to its revision; and (b) the terms and provisions of this Agreement will be construed fairly as to each party hereto and not in favor
of or against either party regardless of which party was generally responsible for the preparation or drafting of this Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement

Section 16.12 Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges that a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement may not reasonably or adequately be compensated in
damages in an action at law and that such a breach may cause the other party irreparable injury and damage. By reason thereof, each party agrees that the other party is
entitled to seek, in addition to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, preliminary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief to
prevent or curtail any breach of this Agreement by the other party; provided, however, that no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy
will be construed as a waiver or prohibition against the pursuing of other legal or equitable remedies in the event of such a breach. Each party agrees that the existence
of any claim, demand, or cause of action of it against the other party, whether predicated upon this Agreement, or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the
enforcement by the other party, or its successors or assigns, of the covenants contained in this Agreement.
Section 16.13 Relationship Between Parties. The parties hereto are acting and performing as independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates the
relationship of partnership, joint venture, sales agency, or principal and agent. Neither party is the agent of the other, and neither party may hold itself out as such to
any other party. All financial obligations associated with each party’s business will be the sole responsibility of such party.

required to provide, and neither SIGA nor SIGA’s Auditor shall be entitled to review, the tax returns or tax records of MMT or those of its Affiliates
and sublicensees. The foregoing right of review may be exercised only once per year and only once with respect to each periodic report and
payment delivered in accordance with Section 6.2. Reports of the results of any such examination (each an “ Audit Report ”) will be (a) limited to
details of any discrepancies in MMT’s records relating to the Product together with an explanation of the discrepancy and the circumstances
giving rise to the discrepancy (b) made available to both Parties and (c) subject to ARTICLE 10. An Audit Report shall become final and binding on
the Parties thirty (30) days following MMT’s receipt thereof, unless MMT delivers written notice of its agreement thereto (in which case such
Audit Report shall become final and binding on the date of delivery of such notice of agreement) or written notice of its disagreement thereto
(“Notice of Disagreement ”) to SIGA in either case on or prior to such date. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by MMT to SIGA, then
the Audit Report shall become final and binding on the Parties on the earlier of (i) the date MMT and SIGA resolve in writing any differences they
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (ii) the date all matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the
Independent Auditor. During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, MMT, SIGA and SIGA’s Auditor shall seek to
resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such
thirty (30) day period, if no resolution has been reached, MMT and SIGA shall submit such dispute to an independent top four certified public
accountant other than SIGA’s Auditor and reasonably acceptable to both Parties (the “ Independent Auditor ”) for resolution of all matters which
remain in dispute which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Independent Auditor shall make a final determination with respect
thereto (with it being understood that the Parties will request that the Independent Auditor deliver to the Parties its resolution in writing not more
than 30 days after its engagement). The Independent Auditor shall make a determination only with respect to the matters still in dispute and, with
respect to each such matter, its determination shall be within the range of the dispute among MMT, SIGA and SIGA’s Auditor. If an Audit Report as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 6.5 (a “Final Audit Report ”) concludes that (i) additional amounts were owed by MMT, MMT will pay
the additional amounts, or (ii) excess payments were made by MMT, SIGA will reimburse such excess payments, in either case ((i) or (ii)), within
thirty (30) Business Days after the date on which an Audit Report is deemed a Final Audit Report. SIGA will bear the full cost of the performance of
any such audit, including the fees of SIGA’s Auditor and the Independent Auditor, unless a Final Audit Report, which covers the entire Calendar
Year, discloses a variance to the detriment of the auditing Party of more than [***] from the amount of the original report, royalty or payment
calculation, in which case MMT will bear the full cost of the performance of such audit. The results of such audit, including any determination
made by the Independent Auditor, will be final, absent manifest error.

without a license or other authorization required by Global Trade Control Laws or in circumstances where reimbursement by the non-utilizing Party
would violate or create exposure to adverse consequences under Global Trade Laws, the non-utilizing Party shall not be responsible for any
payments due to the utilizing Party or any other party resulting from the activities involving such Restricted Party even if the contractual obligation
related thereto has already accrued. Any and all payments due to such utilizing Party or any other party resulting from such activity involving a
Restricted Party shall be entirely at such utilizing Party’s expense. Further, if the conduct of any activity or a transaction under this Agreement was
in violation of applicable Global Trade Control Laws for any reason, such violating Party shall indemnify the other Party for any liability resulting
from such activity or transaction, including any and all fines and penalties assessed to such other Party as a result of such activity or transaction.
6.7 Source of Recovery . Any outstanding amounts due and payable by SIGA pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including
reimbursements for Supply Penalties pursuant to Section 5.5 and any amounts owed to an MMT Indemnitee pursuant to SIGA’s indemnification
obligations in Section 9.1, at MMT’s option, can be set-off by MMT from any Quarterly Payment until such amounts are fully recovered; provided
that any amounts that are subject to a dispute properly brought under ARTICLE 12 may not be set-off pursuant to this Section 6.7.
6.8 Taxes.
(a) Taxes on Income. Each Party will pay all taxes (including related interest and penalties) imposed on its share of income arising
directly or indirectly from the efforts of, or the receipt or deemed receipt of any payment by, such Party under this Agreement.
(b) Tax Withholding. Subject to Section 6.8(c) and Section 6.8(d), if any taxes (including related interest and penalties) are
required to be withheld by or on behalf of MMT with respect to an amount payable to SIGA, (a) MMT will withhold such taxes from such amount,
timely pay the withheld taxes to the proper taxing authority and furnish reasonably satisfactory proof of payment to SIGA; and (b) SIGA will
reasonably assist MMT in its efforts to obtain a refund of or credit for such withholding tax in accordance with Section 6.8(c). Any amount actually
withheld and remitted by MMT to a taxing authority pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to SIGA. If MMT makes a payment without deduction for tax withholding and an amount of tax should have been withheld from such
payment, MMT shall be entitled to recover the under withheld tax by an additional withholding from any amount payable to SIGA under this
Agreement, and to the extent such recovery is insufficient, SIGA shall indemnify MMT for any such amount. No amount shall be withheld, or a
reduced amount shall be withheld, as applicable, if, in accordance with Section 6.8(d), a Party that is entitled to a payment timely furnishes the other
Party with the necessary tax forms and other documents prescribed by Laws, which shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Party receiving
the documents, identifying that the relevant payment is exempt from tax or subject to a reduced tax rate.

are exclusive of any value added tax, sales tax or any similar tax (“ VAT”), which shall be added thereon as applicable. Where VAT is properly added
to a payment made under this Agreement, MMT or SIGA, as applicable, will pay the amount of the VAT, if applicable, but only on receipt of a valid
tax invoice issued in accordance with applicable Law of the country in which the VAT is chargeable.
(d) Tax Cooperation. The Parties agree to cooperate with one another and use reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate tax
withholding, VAT or similar obligations in respect of royalties, milestone payments, and other amounts payable under this Agreement. SIGA and
MMT will provide each other with any applicable tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for the other Party not to withhold tax or to
withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty or pursuant to applicable internal law. Each Party will provide the other with
reasonable assistance to enable the recovery, as permitted by Law, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations resulting from payments made
under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of MMT or SIGA, as applicable, to the extent it has complied with the requirements of
this Section 6.8 in respect of such obligations.

representatives of MMT or its Affiliates in connection with performance by or on behalf of MMT of MMT’s obligations or exercise of MMT’s

indemnification procedures set forth in Section 9.3 and MMT’s defense of the relevant Claims is prejudiced by such failure or (y) such Claims arise

obligation to indemnify MMT pursuant to Section 9.1, as to which Claims each Party will indemnify the other to the extent of its respective liability

9.3 Indemnification Procedures . The Party claiming indemnity under this ARTICLE 9 (the “Indemnified Party”) shall give written notice to
the Party from whom indemnity is being sought (the “ Indemnifying Party”) promptly after becoming aware of a Claim for which indemnity may be
sought hereunder (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim for which indemnity
may be sought as provided in this Section 9.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except
that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice). The Indemnified Party
will provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s reasonable expense, in connection with the defense of
the Claim for which indemnity is being sought. The Indemnified Party may participate in and monitor such defense with counsel of its own
choosing at its sole expense; provided , however , the Indemnifying Party shall assume and conduct the defense of the Claim and may so defend any
such Claim with counsel of its choosing. The Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
not to be unreasonably withheld, unless the settlement involves only the payment of money by the Indemnifying Party. So long as the
Indemnifying Party is actively defending the Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party will not settle or compromise any such Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of the Claim as provided
above, (a) the Indemnified Party may defend against, consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any settlement with respect to such Claim
in any manner the Indemnified Party may deem reasonably appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent
from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), and (b) the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible to indemnify the Indemnified Party as
provided in this ARTICLE 9. The assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the
Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party
of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party’s claim for indemnification.

Source: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/201913.8 Severability. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement will be severable, and the unenforceability of one will not affect the
enforceability of any others or of the remainder of this Agreement. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application
thereof in any circumstances, is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the Parties will negotiate in good faith
with a view to the substitution therefor of a suitable and equitable solution to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of such invalid provision; provided , however , that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the
Parties hereto will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law.
13.9 No Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but
no such waiver will be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition.
The waiver, delay or the failure of any Party to enforce or exercise any term, condition or part of this Agreement at any time or in any one or more
instances will not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term, condition or part, nor will it forfeit any rights, power or
privilege to future enforcement thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a) no claim or right
arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver
or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that
Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all rights and remedies available to a Party, whether under
this Agreement or afforded by Law or otherwise, will be cumulative and not in the alternative to any other rights or remedies that may be available
to such Party.
13.10 Relationship of the Parties . Neither Party will have any responsibility for the hiring, termination or compensation of the other Party’s
employees or for any employee benefits of such employee. No employee or representative of a Party will have any authority to bind or obligate the
other Party to this Agreement for any sum or in any manner whatsoever, or to create or impose any contractual or other liability on the other Party
without said Party’s approval. For all purposes, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, SIGA’s legal
relationship to MMT under this Agreement will be that of independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement gives either Party the power or
authority to act for, bind, or commit the other Party in any way. This Agreement is not a partnership agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will be
construed to establish a relationship of partners, principal and agent or joint venturers between the Parties or their respective employees or
Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a “separate entity” or “business entity” within the meaning of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder and any foreign equivalents thereto. Neither MMT nor SIGA will make any statements,
representations, or commitments of any kind, or to take any action that is binding on the other, without the prior consent of the other Party to do
so.

Safety Reporting Requirements for the Product
1. Scope:
SIGA has a legal and corporate responsibility to comply with applicable regulations governing the collection and reporting of adverse
events (“ AE(s)”), at risk scenarios (“ ARSs”), unexpected therapeutic effects (“ UTEs”), and product quality complaints (“ PQC(s)”)
associated with the Product, as these terms are defined below. For the purposes of this Exhibit, AEs, ARSs, UTEs, and PQCs are collectively
termed “Safety Reports.”
MMT is expressly entitled to perform any regulatory responsibilities for the Product through any of its Affiliates. MMT or an Affiliate of
MMT shall exchange Safety Reports with the SIGA contact listed in section 4.1 Reporting Time-Frames . Throughout this Safety Reporting
Exhibit, SIGA shall be referred to as “SIGA” and MMT and its Affiliates collectively as “Promoter.” At all times SIGA and Promoter shall
follow the procedures set out below.
The procedures described in this Agreement are to be followed for pharmacovigilance activities for the Product, irrespective of any other
activities between SIGA and Promoter which are contained within the Agreement.
2. Definitions:
2.1. Adverse event (AE): an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered the Product. The event need not have a
causal relationship with the treatment or usage. This includes, but is not limited to:
• Abnormal test findings
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs
Source: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019• Changes in physical examination findings
• Hypersensitivity
• Progression/worsening of underlying disease
• Lack of drug efficacy
• Drug abuse
• Drug dependency
• Signs and symptoms resulting from drug withdrawal and drug interactions
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product
2.2. At risk scenarios (ARSs): circumstances where the report does not include an AE per se, but nevertheless needs to be reported to
SIGA. These circumstances include:
• Medication errors (including incorrect prescription or dispensing of a prescription, whether or not administered to the patient)
• Exposure during pregnancy
• Exposure during breastfeeding
• Overdose
• Extravasation
• Occupational exposure
• Off-label use
2.3. Unexpected therapeutic effect (UTEs): a beneficial therapeutic effect of the Product aside from the use for which it had been given.
2.4. Product quality complaint (PQC(s)): is any written or oral expression of dissatisfaction relative to the physical properties, condition,
labelling, potency and/or packaging of the Product, including whether the Product is suspected or confirmed to be counterfeit.
3. Promoter Responsibilities:
3.1. Promoter shall ensure that all employees and, if applicable, subcontractor employees performing activities under this Agreement
(“Promoter Personnel ”) who may become aware of a Safety Report associated with the use of the Product comply with the
requirements set out in this Exhibit.
3.2. If Promoter Personnel become aware of a Safety Report that may be associated with the Product, Promoter shall inform SIGA in
accordance with the reporting procedures included in this Exhibit and as may be updated and provided to Promoter in the future by
SIGA.
3.3. In the event Promoter engages a subcontractor to perform services related to this Agreement, Promoter shall request fulfilment by
that subcontractor of these safety reporting requirements on substantially the same terms as those outlined in this Exhibit, unless it is
established that there is no possibility that the subcontracted services will involve receipt or handling of Safety Reports by the
subcontractor.
Source: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/20193.4. In the event that Promoter receives a communication from a Regulatory Authority relating to the Product, Promoter shall inform SIGA
as soon as possible, but in any event no later than one (1) Business Day or three (3) calendar days of receipt, whichever is shorter.
Where possible, SIGA shall be informed prior to, and have the opportunity to review, any response to the regulatory authority by
Promoter.
4. Reporting Process:
4.1. Reporting Time-Frames: Promoter shall report all Safety Reports to SIGA within two (2) Business Days or four (4) calendar days of
awareness, whichever is shorter. All reports shall be sent to:

4.2. Case Receipt Confirmation: The receipt of Safety Reports from Promoter shall be acknowledged by SIGA in writing no later than one
(1) Business Day following receipt. If acknowledgement of receipt is not received within this timeframe, then Promoter shall contact
SIGA to determine if the source documents need to be re-sent.
4.3. Case Documentation and Record Retention: Promoter shall document all Safety Reports received and reported to SIGA.
Documentation shall include, where possible the name, address, and telephone number of the reporter, and whether consent has been
given by the reporter to be re-contacted by SIGA. Promoter will maintain a record of each Safety Report received, including relevant
source documents, and a record of each Safety Report reported to SIGA for a minimum period of ten (10) years after the expiration or
termination of this Agreement and, if requested, will provide these and any other information requested by SIGA. Notwithstanding
the aforementioned requirement, before Promoter destroys any Safety Reports and associated source documents, or training records,
it will notify SIGA of its intention to do so and afford SIGA the opportunity to retain such records if it so wishes.
Source: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/20195. Data Privacy:
In forwarding Safety Reports to SIGA, Promoter shall comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations on
the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data and the free movement of such data. “Personal Data” means
information that can be used by itself or in combination with other available information to identify a specific individual.  The Promoter shall
collect, use and disclose any Personal Data obtained in the course of performing the safety related activities under this Agreement solely for
the purposes of complying with the regulatory obligations as described in this Agreement, or as otherwise required by law or by a court
order. Promoter shall use electronic, physical, and other safeguards appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent any use or
disclosure of Personal Data other than as provided for by this Agreement. Promoter will also take reasonable precautions to protect the
Personal Data from alteration or destruction.
Promoter shall notify SIGA promptly of any accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of, or access to,
the Personal Data (“ Security Breach”), and take immediate steps to rectify any Security Breach.
6. Audit:
SIGA, or its authorized representatives, shall have the right, at its cost, with reasonable advance notice, during regular business hours, to
audit the facility used by the Promoter in order to review the Promoter activities under this Exhibit including, but not limited to, any
documents relevant to these activities, for compliance with the safety reporting requirements set out in this Exhibit. Where evidence of non-
compliance is identified SIGA and Promoter will jointly discuss to determine appropriate corrective and preventive actions and Promoter will
provide SIGA with regular reports on the completion status of the identified corrective and preventive actions.

PROMOTION AGREEMENT 
(the “Agreement”) 
 
This agreement (the “Agreement”) is made between Charity Tunes Inc., a British Columbia corporation with registered office located at 
Suite 1800, 925 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 3L2 (“Charity Tunes”) and ConAgra Foods Canada 
Inc. (“Sponsor”) a Canada corporation, 5935 Airport Rd, Suite 405, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L4V 1W5. 
 
WHEREAS as a new initiative, Charity Tunes and Sponsor will enter into a promotional partnership, whereby Sponsor will offer Charity 
Tunes music downloads on Sponsor’s Pogo products consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the “Promotion”). 
 
NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the mutual covenants made herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt 
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by each Charity Tunes and Sponsor, the parties agree as follows 
 
A consumer who purchases a specially Designated Sponsor Product (as defined below) will receive exactly one (1) unique pin 
code (a “Pin Code”) in-pack. Such a consumer will be entitled to visit a custom interactive landing page at the 
CharityTunes.com website to enter the unique code and consumer’s valid email address to receive downloads up to a 
maximum of either three (3), five (5), or seven (7) free MP3 song downloads having a retail value of $1.29 per song or less.
Charity Tunes shall make its music catalogue available to the purchasers in MP3 file format to the fullest extent that such 
format is available to Charity Tunes pursuant to any agreements in effect between Charity Tunes and its wholesalers on the 
date of this Agreement. Accordingly, Charity Tunes shall use its best efforts to update its music catalogue with available MP3 
files by June 30, 2009. 
 
The custom interactive landing page shall be designed, operated and maintained at the expense of Sponsor, and shall be 
subject to the mutual approval by Charity Tunes and Sponsor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The landing 
page shall feature the Charity Tunes logo in a size and prominence substantially equal to that of Sponsor. 
 
POGO 8 pack, POGO 10 pack, POGO 20 pack and POGO 30 pack products sold at participating retail locations in Canada 
(individually and collectively the “Designated Sponsor Products”) are the only products for which a Pin Code will be 
distributed and each consumer who purchases a Designated Sponsor Product will receive one and only one Pin Code while 
supplies last and subject to the limitations detailed herein. A Pin Code for three (3) songs shall be distributed exclusively with 
POGO 8 or 10 packs. A Pin Code for five (5) songs shall be distributed exclusively with POGO 20 packs. A Pin Code for seven 
(7) songs shall be distributed exclusively with POGO 30 packs. Designated Sponsor Products sold by Sponsor with the 
Promotion offer may not be sold at a higher list price than the same (or substantially similar) product(s) that do not contain the 
Promotion offer. Pin Codes themselves may not be retailed in any way. 
  
  
1.PROMOTION OFFER: 
2.DESIGNATED SPONSOR PRODUCTS: 
1Pin codes will only be distributed in the Designated Sponsor Products during the Promotion Period (defined below). The total 
number of Pin Codes to be distributed as prizes in the Promotion shall not exceed: (i) 277,760 Pin Codes containing three (3) 
music downloads per Pin Code ; (ii) 130,300 Pin Codes containing five (5) music downloads per Pin Code; and (iii) 27,900 Pin 
Codes containing seven (7) music downloads per Pin Code. No Designated Sponsor Product shall contain more than 1 Pin 
Code per pack. 
 
The distribution limits stated above are the maximum number of Pin Codes that may be distributed in the Promotion. No 3-
song, 5-song, or 7-song Pin Codes may be subdivided, duplicated or distributed in combination with one another. 
 
Charity Tunes agrees to generate the unique Pin Codes for the Promotion. The parties therefore understand and acknowledge 
the critical need to maintain in absolute secrecy the Pin Codes generated for the Promotion such that they are only disclosed 
to the appropriate recipient via the authorized distribution method described herein. If the Pin Codes are made available to the 
public by Sponsor or by any of its employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, except in 
the manner provided for herein, all parties agree that Pin Code security will be deemed compromised, and Charity Tunes may 
terminate all subsequent Pin Code redemptions. 
 
Sponsor agrees that it will not increase the list price to its customers of Designated Sponsor Products that form part of this 
promotion as compared to its otherwise identical products that do not form part of the promotion. 
 
The offer shall be communicated to potential consumers only via in-store on-pack advertising, and retailer flyer advertising. Any 
communication of offer, including but not limited to Sponsor’s rules for the Promotion, must indicate that the offer is only 
available while supplies last. 
 
A consumer who receives a Pin Code for a designated number of music downloads in accordance with paragraph 3 above will 
be directed to visit the custom interactive landing page in order to redeem his/her free music downloads. Consumer will have to 
enter the Pin Code in order to complete the transaction. Consumer will be required to enter the Pin Code exactly as it appears 
in the email and follow the instructions on the web site to download the selected music download. In no case may any Pin 
Code be redeemed later than March 31, 2010. To assist as required with the redemption process, consumers shall have 
access to Charity Tunes customer support by emailing at support@charitytunes.com. 
 
Sponsor shall received 435,960 unique Pin Codes for this Promotion and Sponsor is responsible for maintaining a record of all Pin Codes distributed or withheld, such record being subject to the confidentiality terms set forth above. 
 
Designated Sponsor Products with Pin Codes may be distributed from approximately October 1, 2009 to approximately 
December 31, 2009 (the “Promotion Period”). Eligible Pin Codes may be entered on the www.charitytunes.com website and 
corresponding music downloaded from October 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010. Pin Codes entered for redemption after 11:59:59 
pm PT on March 31, 2010 may be rejected as ineligible. The contents of this section are to be reflected in the Sponsor’s rules 
for the Promotion.

     Communications or Nantz); and

     being given notice thereof and, where applicable, a reasonable opportunity
     to cure the failure (which shall be 10 days in the event of a failure to
     timely make a payment pursuant hereto; 30 days otherwise).  In order to be
     a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in
     detail each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the
     defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item.
 
Ashworth/Nantz
Promotion Agreement
- -------------------
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of repeated intentional
failures to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which have
been noticed in accordance with the terms hereof (regardless of whether such
failures have been cured), the non-defaulting party may immediately terminate
this Agreement upon written notice to the defaulting party without affording a
further opportunity to cure.
Should Nantz Communications or Nantz disagree with the Company as to the
existence of a condition affording the Company the right to so terminate this
Agreement, Nantz Communications or Nantz shall, within thirty (30) days
following the receipt of any such notice of termination, submit the matter to
arbitration pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.
The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the
exclusive remedy of the non-defaulting party hereunder, however, and if a
default is made by either party hereunder, the other may resort to such other
remedies as said party would have been entitled to if this section had been
omitted from this Agreement.  Termination under the provisions of this section
shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party
may otherwise have against the defaulting party.
From and after the termination of the Term all of the rights of the Company to
the use of the Endorsement shall cease absolutely and the Company shall not
thereafter use or refer to the Endorsement in advertising or promotion in any
manner whatsoever.  The Company shall not advertise, promote, distribute or sell
any item whatsoever in connection with the use of any name, figure, design,
logo, trademark or trade name confusingly similar to or suggestive of the
Endorsement following the termination of the Term.
                                   ASSIGNMENT
                                        
     This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Nantz Communications and
Nantz acknowledge that the Services to be rendered by Nantz Communications and
Nantz are unique and personal.  Accordingly, except as otherwise expressly
provided below, neither Nantz Communications nor Nantz shall assign any of their
respective rights or delegate any of their respective duties or obligations
under this Agreement without the written consent of the Company.  Nothing herein
shall prevent Nantz Communications from assigning the monetary benefits of this
Agreement as it may so desire.  Further, inasmuch as it is recognized that Nantz
Communications is the representative of Nantz, Nantz Communications may at any
time assign this Agreement to Nantz and, in such event, Nantz Communications
shall have no further obligation or liability in connection herewith and Nantz
Communications' position vis-a'-vis the Company in connection herewith shall be
in all respects the same as if Nantz Communications had signed this Agreement as
agent rather than as a principal from the beginning.  The rights granted the
Company hereunder shall be used only by it and shall not, without the prior
written consent of Nantz Communications or Nantz, be transferred or assigned toany other.  In the event of the merger or consolidation of the Company with any
other entity, Nantz Communications shall have the right to terminate the
Agreement by so notifying the Company in writing on or before sixty (60) days

successor.  Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Nantz Communications and
Nantz, on the other hand, shall select one arbitrator and the two so selected
shall select a third.  Failing the selection of an arbitrator by either party or
by the two so selected, the claim or controversy shall be settled by the
American Arbitration Association upon the application of either party.  Judgment

                              PROMOTION AGREEMENT
This Promotion Agreement (the "Agreement") is dated as of January 26, 1998
between CNET, Inc. ("CNET") and Cyberian Outpost, Inc. (the "Company"). Pursuant
to this Agreement, CNET will provide various links and other online and
television promotions (collectively, the "Promotions") to the Company to assist
the Company in promoting its products and services and facilitating the sale of
products to potential buyers through its Internet site. CNET will be compensated
by the Company for providing the Promotions. Accordingly, the parties hereby
agree as follows:
1.   Background.
     1.1  The Company. The Company operates an electronic retailing operation
          through its Internet sites located at www.cyberianoutpost.com or
          www.outpost.com (together with any successors to such sites, the
          "Company Site"). Through the Company Site, the Company sells or
          facilitates the sale of various products and services, either directly
          or as an agent for third party vendors. All products and services
          offered for sale through the Company Site are referred to as the
          "Products."
     1.2  CNET. CNET produces television programs and operates a network of
          Internet sites on the world wide web. For purposes of this Agreement,
          the "CNET Sites" refer to any Internet sites operated by CNET or its
          subsidiaries, including without limitation the sites referenced in
          Section 2.5 and Exhibit A.
2.   CNET's Obligations.
     2.1  TV Promotions. CNET will provide the Company one 15 second "spot" for
          Promotions on its syndicated weekly TV program, TV.COM. Promotions
          will run on each weekly episode of TV.COM during the Term; provided
          that TV.COM remains on the air throughout such period. Should TV.COM
          not be run on the air during a portion of the Term, CNET will run two
          download.com banner advertising programs per month during such portion
          of the Term in lieu of the foregoing TV.COM Promotions.
     2.2  Banner Promotions. CNET will provide advertising banners to the
          Company during the Term as described in Exhibit A.
     2.3  Retail Promotions.
 
          2.3.1  CNET will provide for various retail Promotions across the CNET
                 Sites, which may include text/HTML links, buttons, portals and
                 other fixed Promotions that include embedded links to the
                 Company Site (the "Retail Promotions" and, together with the
                 advertising banners contemplated in the preceding paragraph,
                 the "Online Promotions").
          2.3.2  Subject to Section 4 below, CNET will provide the Company with
                 a total of at least (a) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during
                 the first three months of the Term, (b) [XXXXXX] Retail
                 Impressions during the second three months of the Term, (c)
                 [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during the third three months
                 of the Term, and (d) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during
                 the fourth three months of the Term. For such purposes, a
                 "Retail Impression" means the display of one page of a CNET
                 Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails
                 to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding
                 sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display
                 Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following
                 the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the
                 Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been
                 delivered.
     2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will determine the location and
          type of each Retail Promotion displayed throughout the CNET Sites and
          may phase in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are developed.
          CNET currently intends to display Retail Promotions consisting of
          text/HTML links, pre-filled with an appropriate query string or link
          ("Pre-Filled Links"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail
          Promotions contemplated by this Section will be displayed above the
          fold where the graphical layout of the page reasonably permits such
          positioning (as determined by CNET), and in other cases the Retail
          Promotions will be prominently positioned below the fold. For the
          purposes of clarity, the "fold" is defined as the visible portion of
          the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size.
          2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on thesearch query page related to Shopping and on every search
                 results page served by CNET.
          2.4.2  On CNET.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on pages
                 within the site except the Front Door and except for pages
                 within the Personalities and Community sections.
          2.4.3  On BUILDER.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on
                 pages within the site except the Front Door and the "Builder
                 Buzz" section.
 
          2.4.4  On GAMECENTER.COM, NEWS.COM, DOWNLOAD.COM and SHAREWARE.COM,
                 CNET will display a Pre-Filled Link on pages within the site
                 except the Front Door.
          2.4.5  Other pages of the CNET Sites, CNET will display additional
                 Retail Promotions as appropriate and as mutually agreed upon.
     2.5  Design and Production of Online Promotions. The Company will design
          any graphics required for the Online Promotions and provide pre-filled
          query strings or links for all of the Pre-Filled Links, with
          reasonable assistance from CNET, and the Company will supply digital
          copies of such graphics and other materials to CNET. CNET will be
          responsible for incorporating the Online Promotions into the CNET
          Sites and for ensuring that the Online Promotions are accessible to
          users of the CNET Sites ("Users").
     2.6  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,
          CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of
          Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such month and
          the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during
          such month. CNET will also provide standard reporting for banner
          advertisements and television Promotions.
3.   The Company's Obligations:
     3.1  Operation of Company Site. The Company will be responsible for
          ensuring that each link embedded within an Online Promotion takes the
          User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the
          Company Site functions with reasonable reliability and in a
          commercially reasonable manner throughout the Term. In particular, the
          Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance
          standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Any failure by
          the Company to comply with this paragraph will be deemed to be a
          material breach of this Agreement.
     3.2  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,
          the Company will provide a report to CNET indicating the aggregate
          number of referrals from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during
          such month, the resulting number of buyers, the aggregate behavior
          (including orders and sales volume) of those buyers, and the total
          revenue attributable to the Online Promotions minus applicable sales
          tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations (the "CNET Sales"). The
          "CNET Sales" will be counted as sales by the Company to each User who
          accesses the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for
          a period of 4 hours from the referral, CNET and The Company will agree
          on technical procedures to allow the easy and accurate reporting of
          CNET Sales. The Company will make this information available in a
          manner which 
 
          allows CNET and the Company to understand the performance of the
          various Online Promotions.
     3.3  Cash Consideration.
          3.3.1  For each month during the Term, the Company will pay CNET a
                 minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. Payments
                 under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by
                 the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such
                 reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within
                 30 days after the end of each month of the Term.
          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer
                 of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.
     3.4  User Information. At least once each calendar quarter, the Company
          will deliver to CNET all aggregate data collected as a result of the
          CNET Sales, including but not limited to, demographic data, buying
          behavior as measured by conversion to sale, frequency of purchasing,
          average order size, and a comparison to the respective average for the
          Company.
     3.5  Reciprocal Marketing. For the duration of the Term, the Company will
          place a link within the Beta Report Newsletter, the Cyberian Express
          Newsletter, the Gamer's Express newsletter, or any newsletter to which
          users can subscribe to which is provided by the Company to its users
          (expressly excluded from this obligation are emails that are sent by
          the Company for product announcements, or personalized emails sent to
          users upon product purchase. This link will be a text phrase or series
          of text phrases encouraging the users to sign up for CNET's free email
          newsletters for technology News, CNET Dispatch, and Software &
          Hardware Services. CNET will provide all entry forms and operate the
          production and sending of the newsletter. CNET agrees not to
          specifically target these subscribers separately from the generaldatabase of subscribers to CNET's various newsletters. Should the
          Company provide a persistent link or series of links (as distinguished
          from occasional and ad hoc links to product reviews either on the
          Company Site or in any communication by the Company to its customers)
          to a "Technology Content Provider", CNET shall be given at least equal
          prominence to any other Technology Content Provider provided that CNET
          offers comparable editorial content. A Technology Content Provider is
          defined as a company providing news product information or reviews
          about technology products that is not a manufacturer of those
          products.
4.   Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement (the "Term") will begin on
     February 1, 1998 and end on the first anniversary of the date of this
     Agreement; provided that (a) either party may terminate this Agreement,
     effective at any time after the first three 
 
     months of the Term, by giving 30 days' written notice of termination to the
     other party, and (b) either party may terminate this Agreement at any time
     by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if the other
     party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not
     cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party. If
     this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods
     referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions
     applicable thereunder to such three month period will be pro rated
     accordingly.
5.   Exclusivity. For purposes of this agreement "Competing Computer Products
     Retailer" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the
     retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which
     operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than
     two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a
     Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or
     other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any
     CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a)
     standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its
     products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap!
     Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The
     parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from
     displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products
     Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and
     search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to
     the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less
     prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer
     Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.

          that may be delivered by the Company to CNET expressly for inclusion
          in the Promotions, solely for use in connection with the Promotions.
          Any use of the Company Marks by CNET must comply with any reasonable
          usage guidelines communicated by the Company to CNET from time to

          title or interest in or to the Company Marks or the goodwill
          associated therewith, except for the limited usage rights expressly
          provided above. CNET acknowledges and agrees that, as between the
          Company and CNET, the Company is the sole owner of all rights in and
          to the Company Marks.
     6.2  The Company hereby represents and warrants to CNET that the Company
          has, and will have throughout the Term, all necessary rights in and to

     agrees that, as between the Company and CNET, the Company will be solely
     responsible for any claims or other losses associated with or resulting

          harmless from and against any costs, losses, liabilities and expenses,
          including all court costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable

          incur or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,
          arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or
          threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged
          breach by CNET of its representations, warranties or covenants
          hereunder; or (b) the operation of the CNET Sites (except in cases
          where the Company is required to indemnify CNET under the following
          paragraph), including claims of infringement or misappropriation of
          intellectual property rights.
     8.2  Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify and hold
          CNET harmless from and against any Losses that CNET may suffer, incur
          or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or
          threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged
          breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants
          hereunder; (b) the use by CNET of the Company Marks or any content
          provided by the Company to CNET expressly for display in connection

          of the Company Site or the offer or sale of the Products by the

     8.3  Indemnification Procedures. If any party entitled to indemnification
          under this section (an "Indemnified Party") makes an indemnification
          request to the other, the Indemnified Party shall permit the other
          party (the "Indemnifying Party") to control the defense, disposition
          or settlement of the matter at its own expense; provided that the
          Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified
          Party enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition that
          imposes an obligation on the Indemnified Party that is not wholly
          discharged or dischargeable by the Indemnifying Party, or imposes any
          conditions or obligations on the Indemnified Party other than the
          payment of monies that are readily measurable for purposes of
          determining the monetary indemnification or reimbursement obligations
          of Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall 
 
          notify Indemnifying Party promptly of any claim for which Indemnifying
          Party is responsible and shall cooperate with Indemnifying Party in
          every commercially reasonable way to facilitate defense of any such
          claim; provided that the Indemnified Party's failure to notify
          Indemnifying Party shall not diminish Indemnifying Party's obligations
          under this Section except to the extent that Indemnifying Party is
          materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. An Indemnified
          Party shall at all times have the option to participate in any matter
          or litigation through counsel of its own selection and at its own
          expense.
