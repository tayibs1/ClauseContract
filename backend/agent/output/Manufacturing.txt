markings, the circumstances of disclosure or the nature of the information itself, to be proprietary and/or confidential to the disclosing party. All
IAC Property, Sonos Property and Future Products, and any information related to such Future Products, shall always be deemed to be Confidential
Information of the respective party providing such information. Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other tangible form or by
oral, visual or other means, including
Page 20 of 38documents, computer code, prototypes, samples, plans and equipment. Confidential Information may also include information of a third party that
is in the possession of one of the parties and is disclosed to the other party under this Agreement. “Confidential Information” shall not, however,
include any information that (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the
disclosing party through no faults of the receiving party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the
disclosing party to the receiving party through no faults of the receiving party; (iii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of
disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party’s files and/or records; or (iv) is obtained by the receiving party from a third
party lawfully in possession of such information and without a breach of such third party’s obligations of confidentiality.
12.2. Agreement as Confidential Information . The parties shall treat the terms and conditions and the existence of this Agreement as
Confidential Information. Each party shall obtain the other’s consent prior to any publication, presentation, public announcement or press release
concerning the existence or terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sonos may disclose that IAC is manufacturing
its Products to potential investors, partners and customers. The Parties specifically acknowledge that disclosure of this Agreement or the
relationship contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of the other party, would have a material, adverse impact on the other party’s
relationship with its existing manufacturing partner.
12.3. Non-use and Non-disclosure . Each party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except as
necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to any
third party, except that, a receiving party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to those employees of the receiving party who are
required to have the information in order to perform under this Agreement and who have agreed in writing to confidentiality obligations at least as
protective of the disclosing party as those set forth herein. If a receiving party is required by a final authorized order from a recognized and
applicable government body or from a court with competent jurisdiction to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by this
Agreement, the receiving party will provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing party may
seek a protective order or other appropriate relief. Subject to the foregoing sentence, such receiving party may furnish that portion (and only that
portion) of the Confidential Information that the receiving party is legally compelled or is otherwise legally required to disclose; provided, however,
that the receiving party provides such assistance as the disclosing party may reasonably request in obtaining such order or other relief. Neither
party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects that embody the other party’s
Confidential Information and that are provided to the party under this Agreement.
12.4. Maintenance of Confidentiality . Each party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure
and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those
measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care (including, without
limitation, all precautions the receiving party employs with respect to its own confidential materials). No party shall make any copies of the other
party’s Confidential Information except upon the other party’s prior written approval. Each party shall reproduce the other party’s proprietary rights
notices on any such authorized copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original or otherwise that can clearly
express the other party’s proprietary rights. A party receiving Confidential Information shall promptly notify the party disclosing such Confidential
Information of any use or disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement of which the receiving party becomes aware.
Confidentiality shall be maintained for a period of [*] after expiration of this Agreement.

contained herein. Before engaging any IAC Subcontractor, IAC shall first notify and get written approval from Sonos for the use of such IAC
Subcontractor. Sonos shall not unreasonably delay or withhold such approval. IAC represents and warrants that the quality of the services and/or
work product of any IAC Subcontractor shall be of at least the same quality as the services and/or work product delivered by IAC hereunder. In
addition, IAC shall secure any and all Intellectual Property Rights that may pertain to the Sonos Products that are created by such IAC

(CONFIDENTIALITY), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY SONOS FOR THE PRODUCTS IN THE [*] PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO
THE LIABILITY. THIS SECTION DOES NOT LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, OR DAMAGE TO
TANGIBLE PROPERTY.

after notice thereof from the non-defaulting  party stating its intention to terminate this Agreement by reason thereof.
15.3. Termination for Convenience. Either Party may terminate this Agreement hereunder for any reason at its convenience upon one hundred
eighty (180) days prior written notice. In such case, Sonos’ sole liability shall be limited to payment of the amount due under this Agreement, all the

labor disturbance, flood, fire, explosion, epidemic, other hostilities, or failure of the Internet (not resulting from the actions or inactions of such
party). For clarification purposes, an industry wide inability to obtain a Third Party Component is a force majeure event; however, all other material
shortages shall not be considered force majeure events. The party claiming excuse because of force majeure shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly correct such failure or delay in performance and shall promptly notify the other party to this Agreement of any delay or failure to
perform which may be excused by this provision, which notification will also specify the expected date of resumption of performance. In the event
of any such delay, the date of performance shall be extended for a period equal to the time lost by reason of the delay. If, however, either party is
unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement for reasons excused by this provision for a period in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days,
the other party may terminate this Agreement without penalty upon written notice to the other Party.

assume or create any obligations on behalf of the other or to bind the other to any contract, agreement or undertaking with any third party. Nothing
in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, employment or agency relationship between Sonos and IAC.
16.5. Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given by any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be personally
delivered or sent by a reputable overnight mail service (e.g., Federal Express), or by first class mail (certified or registered), or by facsimile confirmed

if in writing and signed by the parties.
16.8. Construction . The Parties agree that any principle of construction or rule of law that provides that an agreement shall be construed
against the drafter of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such agreement shall not apply to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. Titles and headings to articles and sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement. The terms “this Agreement,” “herein,” “hereof,” “hereunder” and similar
expressions refer to this Agreement and not to any particular section or other portion hereof. Unless otherwise specified, “days” means calendar
days. Any use of the term “including” in this Agreement shall be construed as if followed by the phrase “without limitation.”
16.9. Severability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, that
provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this

16.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all exhibits which are incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior and contemporaneous understandings or
agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter.

Sonos Supplier Performance Review
F.1 Introduction .
Sonos supplier management strategy is based on developing strong working relationships with its suppliers. The results Sonos seek will not
occur from random sourcing or selecting suppliers solely on competitive quotations. It will result from working closely with the best existing
suppliers to improve quality, productivity, cost, and all other elements of supplier performance.
The basic strategy entails establishing mutual performance expectations and metrics, providing supplier performance feedback, initiating
corrective actions to ensure continuous improvements, and rewarding the best suppliers with the opportunity for future new business. The
Sonos Supplier Performance Review program provides a framework for effective communication between Sonos and its suppliers regarding
the specific elements of supplier performance. The result of establishing our expectations and supplier performance feedback will ensure
maximum customer satisfaction and increased profitability for all contributors to the system. To accomplish these objectives, Sonos aims to:
• Establish and strengthen long-term partnerships that result in mutual success between the Parties
• Set expectations and metrics that are aggressive yet realistic and achievable
• Utilize a team approach to achieve performance improvements
• Be open to 2-way feedback and commit ourselves to continuous improvement, just as we expect from our supply and
manufacturing partners
Successful supplier performance in the areas of Quality, Business, Engineering, Supply Chain & Operational Excellence is expected and
necessary for both parties to achieve repeat business, increased sales and profitable growth.
F.2 Supplier Performance Review Metrics.
IAC must maintain a competitive advantage by providing products of the highest quality and a competitive total cost, with operations that
demonstrate best in class manufacturing, quality, engineering and supply chain innovation and execution. The Parties will mutually agree in
good faith upon valid performance metrics, goals, and a relevant scoring template and process.
The Parties agree to meet [*] to review IAC’s performance and scoring for the period. It is targeted to alternate meeting locations between
Sonos’ USA HQ office and IAC’s factory. Dates and locations for such reviews will be agreed between the Parties with reasonable notice.

Section 6.4 of this Agreement, Sonos and IAC will review all inputs to the above Pricing Formula for each Product on a quarterly basis, and adjust
Product pricing as necessary to become effective in the next quarter.

THIS MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made this first day of July, 2017 (the “Effective Date”) between Stremicks Heritage
Foods, LLC (“Heritage”), a Delaware limited liability company with an address of 4002 Westminster Avenue, Santa Ana, CA 92703 and PREMIER
NUTRITION CORPORATION (“Premier”), a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business at 5905 Christie Avenue, Emeryville, California 94608
(each a “Party”, collectively, the “Parties”).
WHEREAS, Heritage is engaged in the business of producing food products on a contract basis and desires to produce Products (as defined
below) for Premier at its facilities in [***] as well as at its majority-owned subsidiary, Jasper Products, L.L.C. (“Jasper”) in [***];
WHEREAS, Premier is the owner of certain proprietary formulations, manufacturing processes and techniques and wishes to have Product

Agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with its provisions (“Term”).
2. PRODUCTION OF PRODUCT
(a) Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to
time (the “Products”), for Premier at [***] Heritage’s or Heritage’s wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper’s, [***] (the “Facilities”). [***] For the purposes of
this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any facility that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the
Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage’s [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it
may be used to manufacture the Products. Such facility approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Premier’s facility approval will be
based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the
stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.
(b) Heritage and Premier agree that all Products subject to this Agreement, and their current and subsequently modified respective formulas
are confidential and proprietary, and the sole property of Premier unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties.
(c) Minimum Annual Order Volume. During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order
Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2017, and for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and
ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] Units (the twelve-month periods and the six month period are each a “Contract
Period”).
(d) During the Term, Premier shall have the right (but not the obligation) to order from Heritage quantities of Products in excess of [***] and
provided Heritage has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities of Products, Heritage agrees to produce such additional
quantities per the pricing and terms on Schedule C.
(e) [***]
(f) [***]
(g) Within [***] of each calendar month during the Term, Premier shall provide to Heritage a [***] rolling production forecast which shall
set forth Premier’s non-binding  good faith estimated purchases (each, a “Forecast”) for the [***] period commencing on the date thereof (the “Forecast
Delivery Date”). Each Forecast shall also designate which Facility shall manufacture the Products set forth in such Forecast (i.e. Heritage’s [***] Facility,
Jasper’s [***] Facility, or some other facility agreed to by the Parties). Heritage shall notify Premier, in writing (or email), within [***] of each Forecast
Delivery Date, if Heritage’s or Jasper’s Facilities will not be able to fulfill Premier’s estimated purchases as set out in the [***] of such Forecast. For the
avoidance of doubt, the [***] are
2
Source: BELLRING BRANDS, INC., S-1, 9/20/2019the [***] immediately following the Forecast Delivery Date. If Heritage notifies Premier that it can fulfill Premier’s Forecast for this [***] period, or if it
fails to notify Premier that it cannot fulfill that portion of the Forecast, Heritage shall be obligated to fulfill, or cause Jasper to fulfill as applicable, if
ordered through POs, the full amount of Product set forth for purchase during [***] (“Firm Forecast”).
(h) Within the [***] of each calendar month during the Term, Heritage shall provide to Premier a [***] rolling production forecast which
shall set forth Heritage’s good faith estimated maximum monthly unit volume (“Maximum Volume”) for each Facility during such [***] period.
Modifications to the Maximum Volume shall be negotiated in good faith and agreed upon by both Parties in writing or email by the [***] of the calendar
month.
(i) Premier shall provide Heritage with Purchase Orders (or “POs”) [***] in advance of the date referred to as the “Due Date” in such POs.
The POs, at a minimum, will give the Products and quantities ordered, the Due Date requested, and designate which Facility will manufacture the
Products. “Due Date” shall mean the production start date requested by Premier.
(j) Within [***] of receipt of a PO, Heritage shall (i) provide to Premier email confirmation of acceptance of the PO, a schedule of production
and an estimated production completion date (the “Estimated Completion Date”), or (ii) notify Premier if any term of the PO cannot be met. Heritage’s
failure to notify Premier, within the time specified herein, of an inability to meet a term of the PO shall constitute acceptance of such PO in its entirety. If
Heritage notifies Premier that it or Jasper cannot meet the Due Date, the Parties shall discuss an acceptable alternate date on which production will
commence (the “Production Date”). Once a Due Date is accepted or a Production Date is mutually agreed upon, Heritage shall, or shall cause Jasper to,
use all commercially reasonable efforts to start production on or before the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), but in no case more than [***]
earlier or later than the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable) unless mutually agreed otherwise by Premier.
(k) If PREMIER requests that Products be produced at the Heritage Facility, Heritage may either produce such Products at the Heritage
Facility or cause Jasper to produce such Products at the Jasper Facility, in which case Heritage shall be responsible for all shipping costs of transporting
the Products to the Heritage Facility. If Premier requests that Products be produced at the Jasper Facility, Heritage may either cause Jasper to produce
such Products at the Jasper Facility or produce such Products at the Heritage Facility, in which case Heritage shall be responsible for all shipping costs of
transporting the Products to the Jasper Facility.
(l) If a PO is accepted by Heritage as described in Section 2(j) above but such PO is not filled in accordance with its terms, or if Heritage or
Jasper, as applicable, fails to complete production of the Products [***], Premier shall have the right to use an alternate co-packer for the Products
specified in the PO and Heritage shall, or shall cause Jasper to, provide Premier with Premier owned packaging needed to support such production by an
alternate co-packer.
(m) Purchase Orders will be Premier’s best estimate of its current requirements, but may be amended up or down or canceled in their entirety
by Premier to reflect changing demand for Products. The final Unit quantities on Premier’s Purchase Orders will count towards the MAOV. However, if (i)
any increase or decrease in Unit volume under a particular PO is greater than [***] of the initial PO quantity and (ii) Premier requests such change or
cancellation within the [***] period prior to the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable) (the “[***] Period”), Heritage in its sole discretion, may
charge Premier [***]. In no event shall Premier pay [***] if (i) it cancels or modifies any PO prior to the commencement of the [***] Period (i.e.; prior to
the commencement of the [***] period preceding the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), (ii) Heritage or Jasper fails to timely start production in
the [***] period before or after the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), or (iii) the basis for Premier’s cancellation is a breach by Heritage of its
obligations, representations or warranties hereunder.
3

estimated quantity, including losses, of all Premier-supplied materials used. If the final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the
PO quantity ordered, or if the quantity of production released for shipment within [***] from the last day of production is less than [***] of the PO
quantity, upon request by Premier, Heritage shall take all commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***]. The final
production quantity by Heritage and Jasper will count towards the MAOV requirements.

Forecast are not consistent with historical trends, at Manufacturer’s request, the Parties will meet to discuss the Forecast in good
faith in the context of previous allocations of Product requirements. Such Forecasts represent Customer’s reasonable estimates of the
quantity of Products it will require during the applicable period covered by each such Forecast. Except as otherwise set forth in a
Facility Addendum, each Forecast shall be a non-binding  forecast and for informational purposes only, except that: (i) the portion of
such Forecast covering the first three (3) calendar months reflected therein (the “ Binding Forecast Period ”) shall be binding and shall
constitute a firm order for the quantity of each Product specified therein (each, a “ Firm Order”), (ii) each of months four (4) through six
(6) of a given Forecast may not differ by more than twenty-five percent (25%) (whether positive or negative) from the quantity of such
Product set forth in those months in the previous Forecast, and (iii) each of months seven (7) through twelve (12) of a given Forecast
may not differ by more than fifty percent (50%) (whether positive or negative) from the quantity of such Product set forth in those

month. Manufacturer shall provide to Customer such quantities of Product as may be ordered by Customer pursuant to such
Purchase Orders, up to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the quantity set forth in the most recent Forecast for the applicable period.
In the event that Customer orders quantities of Product above one hundred ten percent (110%) of the quantity set forth in the most
recent Forecast for the applicable period (such quantities above one hundred ten percent (110%) referred to as “ Additional
Quantities ”), Manufacturer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, but shall not be obligated, to supply such Additional
Quantities. For purposes of this paragraph, the most recent Forecast for any given month shall mean the Forecast submitted by
Customer in the month prior to the month in which the applicable Purchase Order is issued. All Purchase Orders shall specify the
quantity and description of Products ordered, the applicable Facility where such Products will be Delivered, the required delivery date
(subject to the provisions of Section 2.4(d)), and the manner of Delivery (including the carrier to be used).
(d) Delivery Date. Unless expressly set forth to the contrary in a Facility Addendum, Customer will issue Purchase Orders for Product no
later than a period equal to the Binding Forecast Period prior to the required delivery date. By way of example only, if the Binding

Product no later than three (3) months prior to the required delivery date.
(e) No Minimum Purchase Obligation; Minimum Order Quantities.
(i) No Obligation . Without limiting Customer’s obligations under Section 2.1(e), 2.4(b), 2.4(c), 2.4(d) or 2.4(e)(ii), Manufacturer
hereby acknowledges and agrees that Customer is not otherwise obligated to purchase any minimum or specific quantity,
volume or dollar amount of Product under any Facility Addendum unless expressly set forth in the applicable Facility
Addendum.
(ii) Minimum Order Quantities . Notwithstanding Section 2.4(e)(i), Customer acknowledges and agrees that (A) each Purchase
Order Customer places hereunder for Product that is either API or Bulk Drug Product shall be equal to, or a whole multiple of,
the Batch Size for such applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum and (B) each Purchase Order that
Customer places hereunder for Product that is Finished Product shall be equal to or greater than the Minimum Order Quantity
for such applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum; provided  that, where Customer places Purchase
Orders under (B) above that exceed the applicable Minimum Order Quantity, Customer shall
-17-

applicable Facility Addendum. As used herein, “ Batch Size” means the production quantity for a given run of a Product SKU
and “Increments” means the quantity step change above the applicable Minimum Order Quantity, in each case, as specified in
the applicable Facility Addendum.
(f) Acceptance and Rejection of Orders . Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a Purchase Order, Manufacturer may reject such
Purchase Order by written notice to Customer only on the basis that it is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including a
Purchase Order containing (i) a delivery schedule that is inconsistent with Section 2.4(d), (ii) a Product quantity that is inconsistent
with Section 2.4(e)(ii), (iii) a Product quantity that is less than the Firm Order for the applicable period or (iv) subject to Section 2.4(c),
a Product quantity that is more than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Forecast for the applicable period. Manufacturer shall be
deemed to have accepted Customer’s Purchase Order for Products in the event it either (a) indicates its acceptance of Customer’s
Purchase Order in writing or (b) does not indicate its rejection of a Purchase Order within ten (10) Business Days of receipt pursuant
to this Section 2.4(f).
(g) Changes to Purchase Orders . Purchase Orders, once submitted to Manufacturer, may be amended only by mutual written agreement
of the Parties; provided  that Manufacturer shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with proposed amendments to
Purchase Orders that Customer may request after sending a Purchase Order to Manufacturer.
(h) Cancellations. In the event that Customer cancels all or part of a Purchase Order ( provided  that a cancellation shall be deemed to have
occurred to the extent that Customer fails to issue a Purchase Order with respect to the full amount of Product contemplated by any
portion of a Forecast with respect to the Binding Forecast Period) and such cancellation is not due to Manufacturer’s breach of this
Agreement or any Facility Addendum, Manufacturer will use good faith efforts to reallocate capacity and mitigate any resultant costs
of such cancellation and, unless otherwise set forth with respect to the relevant cancelled Product under the applicable Facility
Addendum, Customer will be charged for one hundred percent (100%) of any and all non-cancellable  Third-Party costs actually and
reasonably incurred by Manufacturer in accordance with this Agreement prior to cancellation for materials or services related to the
cancelled portion of the Purchase Order for which reasonably acceptable documentation is submitted by Manufacturer to Customer.

(a) Capacity Allocation . In the event that Manufacturer fails to manufacture and deliver Product in accordance with accepted Purchase
Orders or applicable Specifications, Manufacturer shall notify Customer promptly, including details of the reasons for the failure and
Manufacturer’s estimated timeline of when the failure will be corrected. Manufacturer shall be solely responsible for undertaking
commercially reasonable measures to minimize any shortage of Product delivered to Customer as a result of such manufacturing
issues. If Manufacturer fails to manufacture and deliver Product in accordance with accepted Purchase Orders or applicable
Specifications by the delivery date specified in the applicable Purchase Order(s) in accordance with Section 2.4(d), other than due to a
Force Majeure Event, (i) for a period of two (2) or more months past such delivery date four (4) or more times in any rolling twelve (12)
month period, or (ii) for a period of four (4) or more months past such delivery date on one occasion (each of (i) and (ii), a “ Triggering
Event”), then Manufacturer shall use its best efforts to allocate on a quarterly basis its manufacturing capacity and Product Materials
to the manufacture and supply of Products for Customer on a ratable basis based on the use of each during the twelve (12)-month
period immediately preceding such Triggering Event (or either (1) the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum, if the Term is less
than twelve (12) months, or (2) such other period set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum); provided  that (A) if Customer’s
Minimum Order Quantity for the applicable Product(s) exceeds its ratable allocation of manufacturing capacity or Product Materials
(as applicable) for the applicable quarter, Customer shall continue to accrue its allocation of capacity until such quarter when
Customer’s allocation of capacity is equal to or greater than its accrued allocation of capacity and (B) this Section 2.5(a) shall not
apply to the extent that Customer fails to timely provide adequate Customer-Supplied Materials or Buy-Sell Materials to Manufacturer
in accordance with Section 12. For the avoidance of doubt, Manufacturer shall notify Customer promptly in writing of any anticipated
Triggering Event when Manufacturer has reason to believe that such Triggering Event is likely to occur and provide such information
with respect to such anticipated Triggering Event as Customer may reasonably request.
-19-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020(b) Suspension of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement . In the event of a Triggering Event, Customer’s Exclusive Purchase Requirement
with respect to each and every Product that is the subject of the Triggering Event shall be temporarily suspended until such time as
Manufacturer notifies Customer that Manufacturer is able to resume the manufacture and supply of the subject Product(s) on the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (such period referred to as the “ Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period ”);
provided  that, (i) during such Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period, Customer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to limit its orders for the subject Product(s) to the quantities specified in the last Forecast that preceded the Triggering Event
for the applicable period(s) and promptly notify Manufacturer in the event and to the extent that Customer’s orders exceed such
quantities specified in such Forecast and (ii) Customer shall be entitled to take delivery of Product(s) ordered during the Exclusive
Purchase Requirement Suspension Period even if such delivery is scheduled for or actually occurs subsequent to the Exclusive
Purchase Requirement Suspension Period.
(c) Modification of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement . Upon the expiration of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period,
Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume ordering from Manufacturer, on a Product-by-Product  basis, the subject
Product(s) in accordance with Customer’s Exclusive Purchase Requirement during the Exclusivity Period.
(d) Business Continuity . Manufacturer shall maintain a written business continuity plan to be able to assure supply of Product to
Customer in the event of a disruption to supply from the primary location or Facility of manufacture, including any disruption
resulting from a Force Majeure Event and make such plan available from time to time upon Customer’s request.
(e) Remedies. Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on an affected Product-by-affected  Product basis immediately
upon written notice to Manufacturer in the event a Triggering Event (under clause (ii) thereof) continues for more than one hundred
and eighty (180) days. Customer shall also have the right to cancel orders for any quantities of Product affected by any Triggering
Event effective upon notice to Manufacturer, and Customer shall have no further obligations to purchase any such cancelled
quantities of Product. In the event a Triggering Event occurs during the Exclusivity Period, Manufacturer shall, at Manufacturer’s
cost and expense, provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by Customer to assist any alternate manufacturer in meeting
Customer’s requirements for the Product until Manufacturer has remedied the cause of such Triggering Event and is

2.10(h), Technical Support in respect of the affected Product(s). In the event of a Triggering Event, Manufacturer shall be liable for
any actual amounts that Customer is contractually required to pay to any Third-Party customer of Customer that result from
Customer’s inability to supply the affected Product to such Third-Party customer as a direct result of such Triggering Event;
provided  that (1) Customer shall provide to Manufacturer appropriate evidence of such amounts (including invoices from the
applicable customers) and the applicable contractual requirements (redacted, in each case, of information pertaining to pricing and
other commercial terms that are not directly related to the claimed amounts), it being understood and agreed that, upon request,
Manufacturer will enter into customary confidentiality arrangements prior to such information being shared and (2) Manufacturer
shall not be liable for any such amounts in the aggregate in any Fiscal Year in excess of the aggregate Conversion Cost Markup
during such Fiscal Year with respect to all Products manufactured at the Facility that is the subject of the applicable Triggering Event.
“Conversion Cost Markup” means, for a Product for any Fiscal Year, ten percent (10%) of the product of (A) Manufacturer’s Standard
Conversion Cost for such Product for such Fiscal Year and (B) the quantity of such Product ordered by Customer for delivery during
such Fiscal Year. The rights of Customer set forth in this paragraph are in addition to any other rights set forth in this Agreement.
2.6 Delivery; Risk of Loss.

(Incoterms 2010) at the applicable Facility, and all Purchase Orders will be deemed to have been completed when the quantity of
Product made available to Customer at the applicable Facility is between ninety percent (90%) and one hundred and ten percent
(110%) of the quantity of Product set forth in any accepted Purchase Order (each such event, a “ Delivery”). Delivery shall occur by or
within the delivery date(s) set forth in the applicable Purchase Order or such other date as may be agreed to in writing by the Parties
from time to time. Without limiting Customer’s rights and remedies under Section 4.8, Manufacturer acknowledges and agrees that,

Customer upon Delivery to Customer pursuant to Section 2.6(a).
2.7 Procurement of Materials.
(a) Manufacturer shall order and maintain sufficient quantities of all Product Materials, including safety stock as required by the
applicable Facility Addendum, to enable Manufacturer to manufacture and Deliver Product in accordance with its Delivery
obligations under this Agreement and the applicable Facility Addendum. With respect to those Third Party suppliers of Product
Materials used by Manufacturer or its Affiliates in the ordinary course in the manufacturing or supply of a given Product immediately
prior to the Effective Date (“Manufacturer Third Party Suppliers ”), Manufacturer shall be permitted to purchase solely the same
Product Materials from such Manufacturer Third Party Suppliers in connection with its activities under this Agreement without first
obtaining Customer’s prior written consent. Any other Third-Party supplier for Product Materials (or procurement of a different
Product Material from any Third-Party supplier) must be approved in advance in writing by Customer (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Effective Date, as between Manufacturer and
Customer, Manufacturer will be solely responsible for maintaining and establishing relationships with the Third-Party suppliers of
Product Materials.  The costs of all such Product Materials shall be included in the Price of the applicable Product.
(b) Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum for a specific Product, Customer shall have no liability for excess or
obsolete Product Materials purchased by Manufacturer, (x) except as set forth in Section 2.4(h) or Section 7.9 or (y) unless the excess
or obsolescence is caused by a change to the specifications for such Product Materials or the Specifications of a given Product in
accordance with this Agreement after such Product Materials have been purchased by Manufacturer based upon a Firm Order or
accepted Purchase Order).
(c) Customer understands and acknowledges that (i) certain Product Materials have a limited shelf-life, are long lead time items, and are
subject to minimum order quantities specified by the applicable supplier and (ii) Manufacturer will rely on the Firm Orders and
Forecasts to order Product Materials required to meet the Firm Orders (plus safety stock for certain Product Materials of a Product as
reasonably determined by Manufacturer). In addition, Customer understands that, to ensure an orderly supply of the Product
Materials, Manufacturer may elect to purchase the Product Materials in sufficient volumes to meet the production requirements for
Products during part or all of the forecasted periods; provided , however, that Customer shall not have any liability with respect to any
purchase by Manufacturer or any of its Affiliates of labeling or packaging materials (including labels, cartons and leaflets) in excess
of the amount required to meet the Firm Order applicable at such time plus the amount of applicable Product forecasted to be ordered
in months four (4) through six (6) of the Forecast applicable at such time.

rejection or destruction of any Customer-Supplied Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Product, or Product Materials intended for
Customer’s Product to discuss viability for commercial use.
2.8 Product Samples.
If representative lot samples of production batches of Product are requested by Customer in order to satisfy its obligations under
applicable Law, including any regulatory requirements, or to any Governmental Authority, then Manufacturer shall provide Customer (or
any such Third Party as Customer shall designate) with representative lot samples of each production batch of Product promptly upon
Customer’s request. Customer shall be entitled to review, upon reasonable prior written notice, all manufacturing Records relating to such
samples, including all analytical procedures and cleaning validation relating to the equipment used in connection with the manufacture of
the samples. Such Product samples shall be Delivered to Customer (or such Third Party as Customer shall designate) in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Section 2.6(a) and at the Price as determined in accordance with the terms of Section 3. Customer shall pay for such
samples when invoiced in accordance with Section 3.5.
2.9 Storage.
Manufacturer will store Products, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials in accordance with the
requirements of the Quality Agreement. With respect to those Third-Party warehouses used by Manufacturer or its Affiliates in the
ordinary course for the storage of a given Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, or Customer-Supplied Materials immediately prior
to the Effective Date, Manufacturer may engage such Third-Party warehouse to perform the solely same activities for such Product, Buy-
Sell Materials, Product Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials under this Agreement without first obtaining Customer’s prior written
consent. The use of any Third Party warehouse for the storage of any Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, or Customer-
Supplied Materials other than in the manner expressly permitted pursuant to this Section 2.9 must be approved in advance in writing by
Customer, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Manufacturer shall obtain the right for Customer to
audit, at Customer’s expense, any such Third-Party warehouse upon reasonable prior advance written notice and during normal business
hours. Manufacturer has no obligation to store Product more than fifteen (15) Business Days following the requested delivery date for such
Product; provided  that (a) Manufacturer shall be obligated to store Product for such longer
-23-

delays in the manufacture, release, or supply of a particular Product that results in the delivery of a quantity of Product that exceeds
historical or Forecast quantities of Product for the applicable period and; (b) with respect to any Product that Customer reasonably believes
should not be released by Manufacturer, Manufacturer shall store such Product until the Parties’ definitive resolution pursuant to this
Agreement and the Quality Agreement as to whether such Product should be released. At the expiration of the applicable time frame in the
preceding sentence, notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.9 to the contrary, Manufacturer may transport and store the subject
Product at a Third-Party warehouse at Customer’s expense.
2.10 Transitional Support.
(a) On a Product-by-Product  basis, Customer may elect, upon written notice to Manufacturer, for Manufacturer to provide Customer with
reasonable technical support, as more fully set forth in this Section 2.10, to transfer production of a given Product or Products to a
Customer facility or a facility of an alternative source of supply as designated by Customer (such support, “ Technical Support” and
such facility, the “Receiving Site”). Customer may make such election for Technical Support at any time during the Term (including in
the event of a Triggering Event under Section 2.5(a) or in advance of any expiration of this Agreement) or promptly after the
termination or expiration of this Agreement but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the effective date of such termination
or expiration. Such reasonable Technical Support shall consist of:
(i) supply of a technical package to facilitate the transfer of all relevant manufacturing information for such Product(s) to the

Personnel visits to the Receiving Site and training and troubleshooting during the Receiving Site’s first production run of the
applicable Product or Products, in each case, as and to the extent reasonably agreed by Manufacturer in each instance (and subject to
Sections 2.10(d), 2.10(e) and 2.10(f)).
(d) The Parties will work together in good faith to plan for upcoming and ongoing Technical Support needs and to accommodate such
plans in order to maintain ongoing business continuity. In addition, Manufacturer shall have no obligation to hire or retain any
individuals or make any capital expenditures in connection with Technical Support, and Manufacturer’s obligation to provide
Technical Support is contingent upon the continued employment by Manufacturer of those individuals capable of providing such
Technical Support. Manufacturer may terminate its obligation to provide any Technical Support with respect to the applicable Product
under this Agreement if Customer or any of its Affiliates hires any Manufacturer Personnel involved in providing Technical Support
to Customer hereunder (without limiting any applicable non-solicitation  obligations of Customer pursuant to the Business
Combination Agreement).
(e) Customer shall be solely responsible for any and all regulatory or other Governmental Authority requirements, activities and related
costs and expenses that arise in conjunction with any Technical Support, technology transfer of production or production of each

3. Price; Payment; Price Adjustments; Taxes.
3.1 Price.
(a) Initial Price. On a Fiscal Year-by-Fiscal Year basis, Customer shall purchase each Product from Manufacturer at the Price for such
Product for such Fiscal Year, as determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 3. The Price for each Product during the Initial
Price Term (such Price, the “Initial Price” for such Product) is set forth in the Facility Addendum for such Product. Following the
Initial Price Term, the Price of such Product may be adjusted only as set forth in Section 3.1(b) and Section 3.2.
(b) Price in Extension Periods. In the event that Customer elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement or of a Facility Addendum,
the Price for each applicable Product in any Extension Period shall be one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer’s Standard
Product Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer’s Standard Conversion Cost of such Product, each
for the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period with respect to such Product. During each Extension Period, the Price of such
Product may be adjusted as set forth in Section 3.2; provided  that the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period shall operate as
the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below).
-26-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020(c) Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that the Price of each Product
reflects one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer’s Standard Product Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of
Manufacturer’s Standard Conversion Cost of such Product. The Price for each Product will be set forth in the currency specified in
the applicable Facility Addendum.
(d) Changes to the Standard Cost Methodology . Manufacturer shall have the right to change the Standard Cost methodology once per
Fiscal Year; provided  that any change shall be consistent with the Accounting Method and applied across all products manufactured
at the applicable Facility. If Manufacturer elects to change the Standard Cost methodology, Manufacturer shall calculate both (i) the
revised Standard Cost using the methodology effective during the then-current Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility
Addendum and (ii) the percentage change in Standard Cost caused by the change in methodology relative to the former
methodology. If such Standard Cost methodology change results in an increase of Facility Conversion Cost for Products
manufactured for Customer of more than two percent (2%), then Manufacturer shall revert to the former methodology for purposes of
the calculation of Price during such Fiscal Year.
3.2 Price Adjustment.
(a) Product Materials Adjustment .
(i) On a Facility-by-Facility basis, with respect to each full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum, the Price
of each Product manufactured at the applicable Facility will be updated to reflect one hundred percent (100%) of the full
estimated amount of the increase or decrease in the cost of Product Materials for each such Product.
(ii) In each Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report to Customer by no later than the end of
the first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost with respect to each Facility for the
prior Fiscal Year. In the event that the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost differs from the Facility Estimated Product
Materials Cost, when adjusted to reflect actual volume, then Manufacturer shall issue either (A) an invoice to Customer for
any amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer to Customer
reflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and an adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year;
-27-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020provided , however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the
provisions of Section 3.2(e). Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable
Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an
invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of
the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver
of any of Customer’s rights under this Agreement.
(b) Conversion Cost Adjustments .
(i) Subject to the remainder of this Section 3.2(b), on a Facility-by-Facility basis, if the Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility
during any Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum (such Fiscal Year, a
“Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year”) are estimated to be (a) less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Facility
Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below) or (b) greater than one hundred
and twenty-five percent (125%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year ( clauses
(a) and (b) referred to collectively as the “ Facility Conversion Cost Threshold ”), when adjusted to reflect a constant volume
between the Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year and the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year, then the
Price for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year to reflect one
hundred and ten percent (110%) of the increase or decrease in Facility Conversion Costs. An example calculation of the
foregoing Price adjustment is attached hereto as Attachment G. Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.1(b), the “Facility
Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year” shall be, as of the Effective Date, 2019 budget volumes and costs as summarized in the
applicable Facility Addenda; provided  that in each instance in which the Price is adjusted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence of this Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year shall be the applicable Facility
Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year.
(ii) In the event that Price is adjusted as a result of a change to Facility Conversion Cost under Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility
Conversion Cost Threshold for all remaining Fiscal Years in the Initial Term (or Extension Periods as appropriate) will be
reduced such that if Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility during any Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year are
estimated to be (a) less
-28-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020than eighty percent (80%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year or (b) greater
than one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline
Fiscal Year, then the Price for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal
Year to reflect the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in Conversion Cost.
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2(b), Manufacturer shall not have the ability to adjust the Price to
reflect actual volume for Products in a Facility to the extent that Customer has reduced its demand for one or more Products in
such Facility due to Manufacturer’s breach of or other failure to supply under this Agreement or the applicable Facility
Addendum.
(iv) In each Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report to
Customer by no later than the end of the first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the actual volume of Product for each
Facility for the prior Fiscal Year. In the event that the actual Facility Conversion Costs demonstrate that the then applicable
Facility Conversion Cost Threshold has been exceeded, and Manufacturer had not previously adjusted the applicable Price in
accordance with this Section 3.2(b) to account for such adjustment, then Manufacturer shall either issue (A) an invoice to
Customer for any amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer to
Customer reflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and the adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year; provided ,
however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of
Section 3.2(b)(iii). For clarity, any amount owed by Customer to Manufacturer or owed by Manufacturer to Customer shall be
one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer’s Conversion Cost, reduced by a 20% allowance for variable costs.
Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60)
calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay
only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the
dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer’s rights
under this Agreement.
(c) Notwithstanding the above, the price for Buy-Sell Materials will be updated annually in each year following the first Fiscal Year to
reflect one hundred percent (100%) of the full estimated amount of the cost of Buy-Sell Materials to Manufacturer. Customer may not
change the price of Buy-Sell
-29-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020materials during any Fiscal Year. Upon any notification by Customer to Manufacturer of any reduction in the price of Buy-Sell
Materials for the upcoming Fiscal Year, Manufacturer shall submit to Customer an inventory of such Buy-Sell Materials on hand and
a calculation of the positive difference between the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the current
Fiscal Year and the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the upcoming Fiscal Year. Customer shall
promptly and in no event later than sixty (60) days issue to Manufacturer a credit memo in the amount of such positive difference
reflected in Manufacturer’s notice.
(d) The increases or decreases described in this Section 3.2 shall be determined by Manufacturer in a manner consistent with the
accounting methodologies used by Manufacturer as of the Effective Date and shall be based on the applicable Forecasts provided by
Customer in July of the applicable Fiscal Year and applied consistently across Manufacturer’s entire manufacturing operations for the
full Facility.
(e) Manufacturer shall notify Customer of any estimated expected changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later than June 1
of the then-current Fiscal Year and shall notify Customer of any actual changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later than
October 30 of the then-current Fiscal Year. Between June 1 and October 30, the Parties will engage in ongoing discussions to ensure
that any final changes to Prices for the applicable Fiscal Year conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Manufacturer
will promptly respond to Customer’s inquiries regarding any proposed changes to the Price of Products and provide reasonable
documentation to Customer supporting the estimated or actual change in such Prices. Any actual, adjusted Price of each Product
shall become effective on the first day of the first month of such upcoming Fiscal Year.
(f) Any disputes relating to changes in Price for a given Product will be resolved pursuant to Section 3.4.
3.3 Cost Improvement.
At Customer’s reasonable request, Manufacturer and Customer agree to discuss in good faith the implementation of possible cost
reduction opportunities with the objective to reduce the net Price of Product. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Manufacturer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce the price of Product Materials.
-30-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/20203.4 Price Review and Audit Procedure.
(a) Manufacturer shall maintain complete and accurate Records that fairly reflect the relevant costs and calculations used to determine
the Price of each Product and shall retain such Records for a period of not less than three (3) years after the applicable Product was
manufactured and delivered hereunder. With respect to a Price change under Section 3.2 for any Product in an upcoming Fiscal Year, if
Customer requests such a review in writing within thirty (30) days following notice to Customer of such change, then: (i) the Parties
shall reasonably discuss and attempt to resolve any disagreement with respect thereto and (ii) if such disagreement is not resolved
within thirty (30) days following commencement of such discussions, Customer shall have the right, no more than one (1) time per
Fiscal Year each for the subject of (1) and (2) below and on no less than thirty (30) days’ notice to Manufacturer, to appoint a
reputable and internationally recognized independent Third-Party audit firm reasonably acceptable to Manufacturer (and which
agrees to be bound by Manufacturer’s customary confidentiality agreement) to audit such relevant Records, during normal business
hours and on a confidential basis, to verify that, either (1) the change in the relevant Products’ Price for an applicable Facility for the
upcoming Fiscal Year, as applicable, or (2) the true-up determination with respect to (x) the estimated and actual Facility Conversion
Costs of a Facility with respect to any Fiscal Year or (y) the Facility Estimated Product Materials Cost and the Facility Actual Product
Materials Cost with respect to any Fiscal Year, was accurately and equitably calculated by Manufacturer in accordance with this
Agreement; provided  that Customer shall be deemed to have waived its right for such a review if Customer does not make such
request within thirty (30) days following delivery of Manufacturer’s notice to Customer of such increase. For the avoidance of doubt,
any such audit initiated by Customer in accordance with clause (ii) above shall include in the scope of audit all of the Products
manufactured at the applicable Facility, and not be limited in scope to the discrete Product(s) in question. Subject to Section 3.4(b)(2),
Customer shall bear all costs and expenses of conducting such an audit, and such accounting firm shall work on an hourly or flat fee
basis without a contingency fee or other performance or bonus fee. Such accounting firm shall, as promptly as practicable, provide in
writing (I) a detailed report of such audit to Manufacturer and (II) a separate report limited to the Price for the subject Products in the
relevant Fiscal Year as calculated by such accounting firm in accordance with this Agreement to Manufacturer and Customer. The
Price for the Products during a Fiscal Year, as calculated by such accounting firm, absent any manifest error, shall be binding upon the
Parties with respect to such increase or required payment, as applicable; provided  that, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the audit
report, Manufacturer shall have the right to dispute such Price or calculation thereof by submitting written notice to Customer and the
accounting firm accompanied by information supporting Manufacturer’s position. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of Manufacturer’s
notice of dispute, the accounting firm shall issue its final findings with respect to the Price for the relevant Product in the relevant
Fiscal Year and such decision, absent manifest error, shall be binding upon the Parties.
-31-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020(b) If, as a result of any audit by Customer pursuant to Section 3.4(a), the aggregate Price calculated by the accounting firm with respect
to all Products manufactured at the applicable Facility for a Fiscal Year is:
(i) less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the aggregate Price for all such Products established by Manufacturer pursuant to
Section 3.2 for such Products during such Fiscal Year, then, if Customer has made payments to Manufacturer for such
Products at the higher Price established by Manufacturer during such Fiscal Year, Manufacturer shall refund to Customer the
overpayment made by Customer; or
(ii) more than one hundred and five percent (105%) of the aggregate Price for all such Products established by Manufacturer
pursuant to Section 3.2 for such Products during such Fiscal Year, then, if Customer has made payments to Manufacturer for
such Products at the lower Price established by Manufacturer for such period, Customer shall promptly pay Manufacturer for
the amount of the underpayment that should have been paid by Customer;
in each case of clauses  (i) and (ii), (1) such payment to be made within sixty (60) days of the owing Party’s receipt of the relevant
detailed report and final Price pursuant to Section 3.4(a) and (2) Manufacturer shall be responsible for payment of the applicable
accounting firm’s reasonable and actual fees in connection with such audit.
3.5 Invoices and Payment.
Manufacturer shall submit invoices to Customer upon Delivery of Product. All invoices for Products will be in functional currency unless
otherwise specified in the applicable Facility Addendum, and all undisputed payments hereunder shall be in full and be made without any
withholding, offset or any other deductions. Manufacturer shall include the following information on all invoices: (a) the applicable
Purchase Order number and billing address; (b) the quantity of Product delivered (and where applicable, the type, description or part
number, if any); (c) the required delivery date specified in the applicable Purchase Order; (d) the actual date of Delivery; (e) the Price; (f) any
applicable Taxes, transportation charges or other charges provided for in the applicable Purchase Order; (g) the applicable invoice number;
and (h) the Delivery Facility, unless otherwise specified in the Facility Addendum. Subject to Customer’s rights under Section 4.8 to reject
Non-Complying Product or Product that is not otherwise Delivered in accordance with the terms of and conditions of this Agreement,
Manufacturer shall invoice Customer for Product upon Delivery of the applicable Product in accordance with Section 2.6(a). Customer shall
be obligated to pay only for actual quantities of
-32-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020Product delivered. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products,
Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar
days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in
dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any
amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer’s rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be
made under this Agreement is not made within twenty (20) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the “ Late Payment
Date”), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate
equal to the lesser of (i) the Three-Month U.S. dollar LIBOR (Reuters Page LIBOR01) on the Late Payment Date (or the next Business Day if
such Late Payment Date is not a Business Day), and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law. Time for any payments hereunder
shall be of the essence.
3.6 Taxes.
(a) All sums payable under this Agreement are exclusive of any amount in respect of VAT. If any action of one Party (the “Supplier”)
under this Agreement constitutes, for VAT purposes, the making of a supply to another Party (or a member of that Party’s Group) (the
“Recipient”) and VAT is or becomes chargeable on that supply, the Recipient shall pay to the Supplier, in addition to any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement by the Recipient, a sum equal to the amount of the VAT chargeable on that supply against
delivery to the Recipient of a valid VAT invoice issued in accordance with the laws and regulations of the applicable jurisdiction.
(b) Without duplication of amounts covered by Section 3.6(a), Customer (or the applicable Affiliate) shall be responsible for all VAT,
sales, goods and services, use, gross receipts, transfer, consumption and other similar Taxes (excluding, for clarity, Taxes imposed on
net income, profits and gains and franchise Taxes), together with interest, penalties and additions thereto (“ Service Taxes”), imposed
by applicable taxing authorities on the direct sale of Products to Customer or any of its Affiliates or any payment hereunder; provided
that such Service Taxes are shown on a valid invoice. If Manufacturer or any of its Affiliates is required to pay any part of such
Service Taxes, Manufacturer shall provide Customer with evidence that such Service Taxes have been paid, and Customer (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall reimburse Manufacturer for such Service Taxes. Manufacturer shall, upon the reasonable request of
Customer, promptly revise any invoice to the extent such invoice was erroneously itemized or categorized. Each Party shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) minimize the amount of any Service Taxes imposed on the provision
of Services hereunder, including by availing itself of any available exemptions from or reductions to any such
-33-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020Service Taxes, and (ii) cooperate with the other Party in providing any information or documentation that may be reasonably
necessary to minimize such Service Taxes or obtain such exemptions or reductions. If at any time Manufacturer (or any of its
Affiliates) receives a refund (or credit or offset in lieu of a refund) of any Service Taxes borne by Customer (or any of its Affiliates),
then Manufacturer or its Affiliate receiving such refund or utilizing such credit or offset shall promptly pay over the amount of such
refund, credit or offset (net of all reasonable related out-of-pocket  costs, expenses and Taxes incurred in respect thereof) to Customer
or its applicable Affiliate, it being understood that Customer and its applicable Affiliate shall be liable for (x) any subsequent
disallowance of such refund, credit or offset and any related interest, penalties or additions thereto and (y) any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses related to such disallowance.
(c) The Parties and their Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate to determine whether any Tax withholding applies to any amounts paid
under this Agreement and, if so, shall further reasonably cooperate in (i) minimizing the amount of any such withholding Taxes,
including by availing itself of any available exemptions from or reductions to any such withholding Taxes, (ii) providing any
information or documentation that may be reasonably necessary to minimize such withholding Taxes or obtain such exemptions
(including, without limitation, pursuant to any applicable double taxation or similar treaty) or (iii) receiving a refund of such
withholding Taxes or claiming a Tax credit therefor. If any such withholding is required by applicable Law, the paying Party (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall properly and timely withhold and remit such Taxes to the applicable taxing authority and use reasonable
efforts to provide the other Party with a copy of any receipt (where it is common practice for the applicable taxing authority to provide
such a receipt) or other documentation confirming such payment, and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the receiving Party (or its applicable Affiliate). The paying Party (or its applicable Affiliate) shall
not be required to “gross up” any amounts invoiced to the paying Party to account for, or otherwise compensate the receiving Party
(or its applicable Affiliate) for, any Taxes that are required to be withheld under applicable Law.
(d) Where a Party or any member of its Group is required by this Agreement to reimburse or indemnify the other Party or any member of

4. Manufacturing Standards and Quality Assurance.
4.1 Quality Agreement.
On a Facility-by-Facility and Product-by-Product  basis, the Parties will comply with the requirements and provisions set forth in the Quality
Agreement applicable to the applicable Facility and Product, the form of which has been attached hereto as Attachment B and, through
such attachment, made a part hereof. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the applicable Quality Agreement and the terms of this
Agreement, the terms of the Quality Agreement shall govern and control for all quality and regulatory compliance matters and the terms of
this Agreement shall govern and control for all other matters.
4.2 Manufacturing Standards.
Manufacturer shall manufacture and supply each Product (including disposing of all Waste and other materials) in accordance with all
applicable Specifications, applicable Laws, requirements under the applicable Quality Agreement, and this Agreement.
4.3 Manufacturing Changes.
(a) Discretionary Changes . Subject to Section 4.3(b), in the event that either Party desires to change, revise, modify or otherwise alter the
Specifications, manufacturing processes, Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, or Facilities with
respect to a given Product in any manner (each, a “ Manufacturing Change ”), the Party desiring the Manufacturing Change shall
notify the other Party in writing of the proposed Manufacturing Change and the Parties will promptly meet to discuss, in good faith,
the feasibility of implementing such Manufacturing Change and the allocation of costs between the Parties for such Manufacturing
Change; provided  that the requested Manufacturing Change will not be implemented unless and until the Parties mutually agree in
writing to implement such Manufacturing Change. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, the Party requesting the
Manufacturing Change will be responsible for, and will bear the costs of, any filings or other actions that either Party must take with
the applicable Governmental Authority as a result of such Manufacturing Change.
-35-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020(b) Required Changes . If, at any time, a Manufacturing Change is required by a Governmental Authority in a country in which Regulatory
Approval for a given Product has been granted, a Governmental Authority in a country in which Customer seeks to obtain Regulatory
Approval for a given Product, or a Governmental Authority in the country in which the Facility that manufactures a given Product is
located, then the Party that first has knowledge of the required Manufacturing Change shall notify the other Party in writing of such
required Manufacturing Change, and Manufacturer will review such Manufacturing Change with Customer. Manufacturer will bear all
costs and expenses associated with implementing the Manufacturing Change, unless such Manufacturing Change relates solely to a
Product or Products manufactured for Customer (including any required labeling changes), in which case Customer will bear all costs
and expenses associated with implementing such Manufacturing Change for such Product, including any changes to labeling or
packaging, but only to the extent such costs are reasonable and documented.
4.4 Pest Control.
Manufacturer shall manufacture all Products, and Manufacturer shall store all Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied
Materials, and all Products, in a clean, dry area, free from insects and rodents, in a manner to prevent entry of foreign materials and
contamination of Product. Manufacturer’s pest control measures shall include the adequate cleaning of the Facility, control of food and
drink, protection of Product from the environment, monitoring of flying and crawling pests and logs detailing findings and actions taken.
Manufacturer’s pest control program shall be detailed in a written procedure which complies with applicable Laws, including cGMPs, and
which shall be subject to review and approval by Customer. If Customer has specific concerns about procedures in place at any Facility,
Customer will present such issues in its audit findings and the Parties will discuss in good faith a mutually agreeable plan for resolution of
such issues. Failure of Manufacturer to comply with this Section 4.4 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
4.5 Legal and Regulatory Filings and Requests.
(a) Manufacturer shall reasonably cooperate with Customer in responding to all requests for information from, and in making all legally
required filings with, Governmental Authorities in the Territory having jurisdiction to make such requests or require such filings.
Manufacturer shall: (a) obtain and comply with all licenses, consents and permits required under applicable Laws in the Territory (and
Manufacturer shall provide Customer with a
-36-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020copy of all such licenses, consents and permits that are material upon Customer’s reasonable request); and (b) comply with all
applicable Laws in the Territory with respect to its manufacturing and packaging processes, the Facility or otherwise, to permit the
performance of its obligations hereunder. Upon Customer’s request, Manufacturer shall apply for and obtain Certificates of
Pharmaceutical Production (“CPP”) from the Governmental Authorities of the country where the Facility is located, such CPPs to be
issued to countries where CPPs according to Customer’s opinion are required. Manufacturer shall pay all reasonable costs necessary
to obtain such CPPs and be entitled to be reimbursed against invoice by Customer at cost; provided  that Manufacturer shall make
good faith efforts to consolidate its invoices for such reimbursement for CPPs and submit to Customer on a Fiscal Year quarterly
basis.
(b) In the event that Customer wishes to extend the Territory with respect to a certain Product, Customer shall notify Manufacturer of
such request and Manufacturer shall consider Customer’s request in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the
Parties agree to extend the Territory with respect to a certain Product, any resulting Manufacturing Change shall be treated as a
discretionary Manufacturing Change and governed by Section 4.3(a).
4.6 Quality Tests and Checks.
Manufacturer shall perform all bulk holding stability, manufacturing trials, validation (including, but not limited to, method, process and
equipment cleaning validation), raw material, in-process,  bulk finished product and stability (chemical and/or microbial) tests or checks
required to assure the quality of a given Product and any tests or checks required by the Specifications, the Quality Agreement, applicable
Facility Addendum or applicable Laws. With respect to any Product manufactured prior to Closing or located at a Facility as of Closing,
Manufacturer shall maintain, continue and complete any and all such activities, tests and checks, including, without limitation, all ongoing
stability testing. All costs associated with the performance of Manufacturer’s obligations under this Section 4.6 (including with respect to
any Product manufactured prior to Closing or located at a Facility as of Closing) are included in the Price of each Product and, accordingly,
Manufacturer shall perform the foregoing at its cost and expense, without further reimbursement from Customer. Manufacturer shall obtain
Product for these tests from batches of Product manufactured under this Agreement, and Manufacturer is responsible for providing all
necessary technical, quality and operational resources. All tests and test results shall be performed, documented and summarized by
Manufacturer in accordance with the Specifications, Quality Agreement, applicable Facility Addendum, applicable Laws and reasonable
quality assurance requirements provided by Customer to Manufacturer in writing. Manufacturer shall maintain all production Records and

(such non-conforming Product, “Non-Complying Product”), without the prior written approval of Customer. Manufacturer shall quarantine
all such Non-Complying Products and shall promptly submit to Customer a report detailing the nature of such non-compliance and
Manufacturer’s recommended disposition, including the investigation and testing done. Manufacturer shall also provide any additional
information regarding such Non-Complying Product as may reasonably be requested by Customer. Customer shall not be required to pay
for any Non-Complying Product or for the destruction or other disposition thereof (unless an investigation determines that the root cause
for such Product being Non-Complying Product is Non-Complying Buy-Sell Materials or Non-Complying Customer-Supplied Material).
4.8 Rejection of Non-Complying Product.
(a) Customer’s Ability to Reject. Customer may reject any Non-Complying Product or Product that is not delivered to Customer in
accordance with this Agreement by providing written notice of such rejection to Manufacturer within seventy-five (75) days
following Customer’s receipt of any Delivery of Product hereunder; provided , however, that Customer may, until the expiry date for a
Product, provide notice of rejection of any Delivery of such Product having (i) latent defects, (ii) any defects that are not reasonably
discoverable by Customer through standard inspection and testing of Products or (iii) defects caused by the breach by Manufacturer
of any of its representations or warranties under this Agreement (collectively, “ Latent Defects ”); provided , further, that, and
notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall notify Manufacturer within sixty (60) days after Customer first becomes aware of any
such Latent Defect.
(b) Manufacturer’s Ability to Reject . Manufacturer may reject any Non-Complying Product by (i) providing Customer with no less than
sixty (60) days’ prior written notice of Manufacturer’s intention to reject such Non-Complying Product along with the documentation
set forth in Section 4.7, (ii) meeting with Customer at Customer’s request to discuss the basis for the proposed rejection of the subject
Non-Complying Product, and (iii) providing Customer with notice of rejection in the event that Manufacturer rejects the subject Non-
Complying Product at the end of such sixty (60) day period (or such other time frame as the parties may agree upon).
(c) Manufacturer ’s Obligation; Replacement. Manufacturer shall respond to any rejection, defect notice or any quality-related complaint
from Customer pursuant to Section 4.8(a) in a timely manner or such other time frame as may be specified in the applicable Quality
Agreement. Manufacturer shall conduct an analysis of the causes of any such complaint, shall report to Customer on any corrective
action taken and shall reasonably consider
-38-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020Customer’s suggestions related to such corrective action or other quality-related matters. Customer shall promptly return any Product
(or portions thereof) rejected pursuant to Section 4.8(a) to Manufacturer at Manufacturer’s expense. With respect to any Non-
Complying Product rejected by Customer, in addition to any other rights or remedies of Customer hereunder, Customer may elect, in
its sole discretion, upon written notice to Manufacturer to either (i) have Manufacturer replace any Non-Complying Product as soon
as practicable at no additional charge to Customer; provided  that (A) the Manufacturer shall replace such Non-Complying Product
within a period of ninety (90) days beginning on the date that the Manufacturer confirms or a Third-Party laboratory determines that
the subject Product is a Non-Complying Product, and (B) if Manufacturer fails to replace such Non-Complying Product within such
ninety (90) day period, then a Triggering Event shall be deemed to have occurred and the provisions of Section 2.5 shall apply; or (ii)
be reimbursed for the Price of the Non-Complying Product actually paid. Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for the cost of all
Customer-Supplied Materials used to manufacture any Non-Complying Product (unless such Product is a Non-Complying Product
due to any Non-Complying Customer-Supplied Material, as applicable).
(d) Independent Testing . If the Parties are unable to agree on whether Product rejected by Customer is Non-Complying Product, then
Manufacturer may hire an independent Third-Party laboratory, subject to Customer’s prior written approval of such laboratory, not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to perform testing on such rejected Product in accordance with the Specifications,
applicable Laws and the Quality Agreement, which Third Party laboratory shall promptly provide the results thereof to Customer and
Manufacturer. Manufacturer must engage such Third-Party laboratory within the thirty (30) day period following Manufacturer’s
receipt of Customer’s rejection notice. If Manufacturer fails to engage such Third-Party laboratory during such thirty (30) day period,
then Manufacturer will be deemed to have waived its right to engage such Third-Party laboratory. The determination of such tests
shall be binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder; provided  that, if such tests are unable to determine whether or not such
rejected Product is Non-Complying Product, or if Manufacturer does not engage such Third-Party laboratory within the thirty (30)
day period, then such Product shall be deemed to be Non-Complying Product. If such tests determine that the rejected Product is, or
such Product is so deemed to be, Non-Complying Product, then Manufacturer shall bear the costs of such tests and Customer’s
remedies with respect to Non-Complying Product as set forth in this Agreement shall apply to such Non-Complying Product.
Otherwise, Customer shall (i) bear the costs of such tests and shall remain obligated to pay Manufacturer the Price for such Product
in accordance with Section 3 and (ii) reimburse Manufacturer for any shipping charges paid by Manufacturer pursuant to Section
4.8(c) with respect to the return of such
-39-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020Product to Manufacturer. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, if Customer reasonably requests in writing, then Manufacturer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to re-deliver such Product to Customer at Customer’s expense. For the avoidance of doubt,
provided that the Product conforms to the minimum shelf-life dating set forth in Section 5.2(e)(v) upon initial Delivery, such minimum
shelf-life dating requirement shall not apply to the subject Product upon re-delivery in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.
(e) Survival. The provisions of this Section 4.8 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement or the applicable Facility
Addendum.
4.9 Disposal of Rejected and Non-Complying Product.
All Non-Complying Product and Product rejected pursuant to this Agreement shall be removed (if applicable) and disposed of by
Manufacturer in accordance with all applicable Laws, and as approved in advance by Customer in writing (such disposal cost to be at
Manufacturer’s expense, unless it is subsequently determined that Customer wrongly rejected such Product pursuant to Section 4.8).
Manufacturer shall make documentation relating to such disposition available to Customer upon Customer’s reasonable request.
Manufacturer shall not sell for salvage or for any other purpose any rejected or Non-Complying Product, without the prior written approval
of Customer. Manufacturer shall destroy all Non-Complying Product prior to disposal and Manufacturer shall deface and render unreadable

Product containing a latent defect, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to Customer under this Agreement,
Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for Customer’s costs and expenses associated with such Recall, including costs of materials
supplied by Customer (including Customer-Supplied Materials), shipping costs, administrative costs associated with arranging and
coordinating the Recall and all actual Third Party costs associated with the distribution of replacement Product; provided  that
Customer shall be solely responsible for all, and shall reimburse Manufacturer for Manufacturer’s costs and expenses associated with
any Recall to the extent such Recall does not result from a breach by Manufacturer of this Agreement ( e.g., is due to any Non-
Complying Customer-Supplied Material or Non-Complying Buy-Sell Material).
4.12 Inspections.
Subject to the remainder of this Section 4.12, no more than once per calendar year, upon thirty (30) days’ advance written notice to
Manufacturer, Customer may physically inspect or audit (consistent with Section 15.2) the Facilities under this Section 4.12; provided  that
Customer will use good faith efforts to choose dates of inspection or audit that do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of
Manufacturer’s business; provided , further, that Customer shall consider in good faith any alternative dates of inspection or audit
proposed by Manufacturer within five (5) days of Manufacturer’s receipt of such notice (it being understood that nothing in this Section
4.12 shall require Customer to accept any such proposed alternative dates of inspection or audit). Notwithstanding the limits set forth in the
-41-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020foregoing sentence, Customer may more frequently conduct “for cause” physical inspections or audits of a Facility with five (5) days’

7. Term; Termination.
7.1 Term of Agreement.
Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Facility Addendum, this Agreement (a) shall commence on the Effective Date and shall

particular Product, upon written notice to the other Party in the event of a material breach by the other Party of any term of this
Agreement or Facility Addendum with respect to such Product, which breach remains uncured for ninety (90) calendar days following
written notice to such breaching Party of such material breach.

days following written notice to such breaching Party of such material breach.
(c) For clarity, in the event that multiple Products are manufactured by or on behalf of Manufacturer under this Agreement in the same
Facility, a material breach by Manufacturer of this Agreement or Facility Addendum that is an act or omission specific to one or more
Products in a Facility, but not all Products in such Facility, shall give rise to an ability of Customer to terminate this Agreement solely
with respect to the affected Product(s) under Section 7.3(a) but shall not give rise to an ability of Customer to terminate the relevant
Facility Addendum under Section 7.3(b).
7.4 Termination for Disposition of Facility.

such other Party shall be entitled to (i) terminate this Agreement or any and all Facility Addenda for cause immediately upon written notice
to the Insolvent Party or (ii) request that the Insolvent Party or its successor provide adequate assurances of continued and future
performance in form and substance acceptable to such other Party, which shall be provided by the Insolvent Party within ten (10) calendar
days of such request, and the other Party may terminate this Agreement and any or all Facility Addenda for cause immediately upon written

Manufacturer with respect to the performance of any obligations hereunder has accepted any payment, item, or benefit, regardless of value,
as an improper inducement to award, obtain or retain business or otherwise gain or grant an improper business advantage from or to any
other Person or entity. Further, in the event of such termination, Manufacturer shall not be entitled to any further payment, regardless of
any activities undertaken or agreements with additional Third Parties entered into by Manufacturer prior to such termination, and

violating any then-current Laws.
(b) This Agreement and/or any or all Facility Addenda shall be deemed to be terminated by Customer on a Product-by-Product  basis

of, and securing of Regulatory Approval for, another supplier of such terminated Product or (ii) unless otherwise set forth in the
applicable Facility Addendum as the “Inventory Tail Period” for such Product, a time period that reflects Customer’s reasonable
needs of such Product as mutually agreed upon by the Parties in good faith. Manufacturer shall take such further action, at
Manufacturer’s expense, that Customer may reasonably request to minimize delay and expense arising from termination or expiration
of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Manufacturer’s obligation to supply Product pursuant to this Section 7.8(b) shall be
subject to and governed by the terms of this Agreement, including terms pertaining to Forecasts and Purchase Orders and payment

notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, including the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for
indemnification, and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any Indemnitee to provide notice as provided in this Section 10.3(a)
shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 10, except to the extent, and only to the extent, that such
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice in accordance with this Section 10.3(a).
(b) An Indemnifying Party may elect (but shall not be required) to defend (and seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying
Party’s own expense and by such Indemnifying Party’s own counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee), any Third-Party Claim; provided  that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend such Third-Party Claim and
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate
-60-
Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020counsel for all Indemnitees if the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal action, indictment or
allegation or if such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee (and not any Indemnifying Party
or any of its Affiliates). Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 10.3(a) (or
sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether
the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations
or exceptions to its defense. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee; provided ,
however, in the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim but has specified, and
continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one
separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party; and provided  further that the Indemnifying Party will
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if, based on the reasonable opinion of legal counsel to the
Indemnitee, a conflict or potential conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee which makes
representation of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct.
(c) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its
election as provided in Section 10.3(b), then the applicable Indemnitee may defend such Third-Party Claim at the cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party to the extent indemnification is available under the terms of this Agreement. If an Indemnifying Party elects
not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section
10.3(b), then, it shall not be a defense to any obligation of the Indemnifying Party to pay any amount in respect of such Third-Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party was not consulted in the defense thereof, that such Indemnifying Party’s views or opinions as to
the conduct of such defense were not accepted or adopted, that such Indemnifying Party does not approve of the quality or manner
of the defense thereof or, subject to Section 10.3(d), that such Third-Party Claim was incurred by reason of a settlement rather than by
a judgment or other determination of liability.
(d) Neither Party may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim for which either Party is seeking to be indemnified hereunder without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such
settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages that are fully payable by the settling or compromising party, does not
involve any admission, finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of Law by the other Party and provides for a full,
unconditional and irrevocable release of the other Party from all Liability in connection with the Third-Party Claim.

Personnel that are indemnitees under Section 10.1 or Section 10.2, as applicable) under this Agreement for the initial twelve (12) month
period immediately following the Effective Date, and for any twelve (12) month period thereafter during the Term, shall exceed, on a
cumulative basis, the amount that is one and one half (1 1∕2) times the aggregate amounts paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement
in the preceding twelve (12) month period preceding the loss date by Customer to Manufacturer but solely with respect to the supply
hereunder of Product (or Products) for which such corresponding liability arose (the “ Affected Products ”) and not any other
Products (or if, as of the time the liability arises, this Agreement has not been in effect for twelve (12) months, then the amounts paid
or payable by Customer to Manufacturer hereunder during the period from the Effective Date until such time the liability arises, shall
be annualized to a full twelve (12) months but solely with respect to the supply hereunder of the Affected Product(s) and not any
other Products).

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/202010.5 Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts.
(a) The Parties intend that any Loss subject to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Section 10 will be net of Insurance
Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-pocket  costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any
Person by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of any indemnifiable Liability. Accordingly, the amount that any Indemnifying
Party is required to pay to any Indemnitee will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any
out-of-pocket  costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any Person by or on behalf of such Indemnitee in respect of
the related Loss. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an “ Indemnity Payment”) required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying
Party in respect of any Loss and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds or any other amounts in respect of the related Loss, then
the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount
of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds or such other amounts (net of any out-of-pocket  costs
or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.
(b) An insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely
by virtue of any provisions contained in this Agreement, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly
understood and agreed that no insurer or any other Third Party shall be entitled to a “wind-fall” ( i.e., a benefit that such insurer or
other Third Party would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification
provisions hereof. Each Party shall, and shall cause the members of its Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into
account the probability of success on the merits and the cost of expending such efforts, including attorneys’ fees and expenses) to
collect or recover any Insurance Proceeds that may be collectible or recoverable respecting the Liabilities for which indemnification
may be available under this Section 10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party may not delay making any
indemnification payment required under the terms of this Agreement, or otherwise satisfying any indemnification obligation, pending
the outcome of any Action to collect or recover Insurance Proceeds, and an Indemnitee need not attempt to collect any Insurance
Proceeds prior to making a claim for indemnification or receiving any Indemnity Payment otherwise owed to it under this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.

(a) Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10
shall be paid reasonably promptly (but in any event within sixty (60) days of the final determination of the amount that the Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10) by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upon
demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such
indemnification payment, documentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually
reduce the amount of such Liabilities.
(b) If (i) a Party incurs any Liability arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) an adequate legal or equitable remedy
is not available for any reason against the other Party to satisfy the Liability incurred by the incurring Party; and (iii) a legal or
equitable remedy may be available to the other Party against a Third Party for such Liability, then the other Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the incurring Party, at the incurring Party’s expense, to permit the incurring Party to
obtain the benefits of such legal or equitable remedy against the Third Party.
(c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in
respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant or
plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party
in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or
claim.
(d) In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party
shall so request, the Parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant or otherwise add the
Indemnifying Party as party thereto, if at all practicable. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not
requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in this Section 10, and the
Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs,
sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys’ fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement,
and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

14. Supply Chain Security.
14.1 Supply Chain Representations.
Manufacturer represents, warrants and covenants to Customer that:
Manufacturer has reviewed its supply chain security procedures and that these procedures and their implementation are, and shall remain
during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the importer security criteria set forth by the “C-TPAT.” Manufacturer represents
and warrants that it has developed and implemented, or shall develop and implement within sixty (60) calendar days of its execution of this

14.2 C-TPAT.
Manufacturer acknowledges that Customer is a certified member of C-TPAT. As a C-TPAT member, Customer is required to make periodic
assessment of its international supply chain based upon C-TPAT security criteria. Manufacturer agrees to conduct and document an annual
security audit at each of its Facilities and to take all necessary corrective actions to ensure the continued participation of Customer in C-
TPAT. Manufacturer agrees to share with Customer the results of such annual audits and agrees to prepare and submit to Customer a report
on the corrective actions taken in response thereto. In addition, Customer may audit Manufacturer’s Records and Facilities for the purpose
of verifying that Manufacturer’s procedures are in accordance with the C-TPAT security criteria, and Manufacturer shall provide Customer
with access to Manufacturer’s Records and Facilities reasonably necessary for the purpose of conducting such audit. Manufacturer agrees
to notify Customer of any event that has resulted in or threatens the loss of its C-TPAT Benefits (if it is a member of the C-TPAT program) or
alternatively jeopardizes Customer’s retention of its own C-TPAT Benefits. In an effort to secure each part of the supply chain,
Manufacturer agrees to work in good faith to become a member of the C-TPAT program, if Manufacturer is organized or incorporated in the
United States, Mexico or Canada, or the equivalent supply chain security program criteria administered by the customs administration in
Manufacturer’s home country if Manufacturer is not organized or incorporated in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

Record Retention Period, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice to Manufacturer (but in no event more
than one (1) time per year except “for cause”). Manufacturer shall make such Records readily available for such audit. Any Records or
information accessed or otherwise obtained by Customer or its representatives in connection with any audit (including any audit pursuant
to Section 3.4) shall be deemed Manufacturer’s confidential and proprietary Information and each representative of Customer will be
subject to non-use  and other confidentiality obligations substantially comparable to those set forth herein for Customer. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 3.4, if any financial audit reveals that Manufacturer has overcharged Customer, Manufacturer shall reimburse
Customer for such overcharge within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer’s receipt of the relevant audit results, and in the event that any such
overcharge equals an amount equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of the total amounts invoiced during the period under such audit,
then Manufacturer shall promptly reimburse Customer for all reasonable Third Party costs and expenses actually incurred in the conduct of
such audit. If any financial audit reveals that Customer has underpaid Manufacturer, Customer shall reimburse Manufacturer for such
underpayment within thirty (30) days of Customer’s receipt of the relevant audit results. For clarity, if there is a conflict between Section
3.4(a) and this Section 15.2 with respect to the review of a Price increase, Section 3.4(a) shall govern and control.

5.15 DMF/Amendment. Upon Magenta’s reasonable request and order, Bachem will compile a DMF for the Product in cooperation and mutual
agreement with Magenta. Bachem hereby grants to Magenta, at no additional cost, reference rights to the DMFs, which are necessary to support
Magenta’s regulatory submissions with respect to the Product. Bachem shall provide reasonable advance written notice to Magenta prior to
amending any Bachem DMF that is referenced in a filed IND of Magenta or in a proposed IND filing of Magenta. Bachem will, at Magenta’s
expense, provide reasonable assistance as necessary so that the FDA (and/or equivalent foreign regulatory authority) can reference the relevant
DMF. Bachem shall not permit the FDA or any other regulatory authority to reference its DMF in order to permit a Third Party to develop,
manufacture or commercialize [***] or any products that incorporate [***] or compete with [***]. In the event that the Parties agree that Bachem
will not file a DMF in connection with a Project Plan, Bachem shall instead fully cooperate with Magenta, and provide a quote (similar to the
compiling of a DMF) to provide all information, data, and rights of reference reasonably required by Magenta in connection with its regulatory and
governmental filings related to Product.
5.16 Waste Disposal . Bachem shall generate, handle, store, ship and dispose of all wastes associated with its manufacture of Product in
accordance with Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if any specially regulated waste must be removed pursuant to a given
Project Plan, such specially regulated waste and the process for its removal shall be expressly set forth in such Project Plan. If the specially
regulated waste is solely attributable to Magenta’s Product and the Specifications and instructions for production of such Product, then unless the
Parties otherwise agree, Magenta shall be responsible for the reasonable costs associated with the removal of such specially regulated waste. Such
costs shall be included in the Project Plan or, if not specified therein, included in the price of the Services and Product.
5.17 Audits . Magenta and its agents and designees shall have the right to audit Bachem’s facilities, systems, records, procedures, and
documentation related to this Agreement. In connection with any such audit, Bachem shall also provide Magenta access to its personnel. Magenta
may conduct no more than one (1)  technical visit and one (1)  quality assurance audit per year, unless there is cause for an additional audit (i.e., a
technical issue or quality issue). Such audits may be conducted upon reasonable notice during the term of this Agreement and for [***] thereafter.
On-site technical discussions may also be requested and held at mutually agreeable times.
5.18 Person-In-Plant. If reasonably requested by Magenta, at a mutually agreed day and time, Bachem will permit and provide working space
for Magenta to staff one person on location at Bachem’s premises, limited to no more than [***] days, during preparation for manufacturing and
packaging of the Product. Such person shall be given reasonable access to all records, facilities and personnel working on any Services or Project
Plans for the purpose or providing advice, coordinating reviews, approvals or any other actions required to ensure compliance with this Agreement

compliance with the Specifications. Magenta shall have [***] after receipt of the Product to notify Bachem in writing of any rejection of Product
based on a sufficiently documented claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications. In the event that Magenta does not inform Bachem
within the [***] period that the Product does not meet the Specifications, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product. If there is no
dispute between the Parties over a claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications, Bachem shall (i)  replace or (ii) with Magenta’s prior written
consent, reprocess or rework the rejected Product within an agreed upon time frame, after the notice of such rejection, and in any case as soon as

Specifications and the other Party’s test results fall outside the relevant Specifications, or there exists a dispute between the Parties over the extent
to which such failure is due to acts or omissions of Bachem, the Parties shall cause an independent GMP laboratory or appropriate experts promptly
to review records, test data and perform comparative tests and/or analyses on samples of the alleged defective Product. Such independent
laboratory shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The independent laboratory’s results shall be in writing and shall be final and binding save
for manifest error. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the costs associated with such testing and review shall be borne by the
Party against whom the independent laboratory rules.

any obligation to deliver the remaining quantity of the Product or (ii)  Bachem shall deliver the remaining quantity of the Product as soon as
reasonably possible after the date Magenta notifies Bachem of such election. Magenta and Bachem will agree upon the time period to deliver the
remaining Product allowed under clause (ii) [***] of the missed delivery date (or, if applicable, the date on which Bachem notifies Magenta that

allocated in accordance with each Party’s share of responsibility.
Section 7. TERM AND TERMINATION
7.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall extend for a period of Five (5)  years thereafter (“ Initial Term”),
unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided herein or is extended by mutual written agreement of the Parties. This Agreement may be
renewed for additional periods of one (1)  year (each such additional period, a “ Renewal Term”) unless either Party provides notice of nonrenewal

Order that contains an Excess Order, Antares shall notify AMAG in the Order Acceptance whether Antares and/or its
Subcontractors will fulfill such Excess Order (or part thereof) and the expected delivery date for fulfillment. The decision to fulfill
any Excess Order may be made by Antares in its sole discretion and Antares shall not be liable for any failure to deliver any
Product, sample Product or Trainers set forth in any Excess Order; provided that Antares meets its obligations consistent with the
Binding Forecast. AMAG’s failure to deliver a Purchase Order consistent with the volumes of Product, sample Product and/or
Trainers under any Binding Forecast, shall not relieve AMAG of its obligation to purchase such volumes of Product, sample
Product and/or Trainers. The terms of this Agreement shall be controlling and any additional or inconsistent terms or conditions
contained on any Forecast, Purchase Order, Order Acceptance, invoice or similar documentation given or received by the Parties
shall have no effect and such terms and conditions are expressly disclaimed and excluded.

delivered quantity of Product, sample Product or Trainers (as the case may be) that falls within applicable
industry standards shall be accepted by AMAG as delivery in full of the ordered quantities set forth on any
Firm Order and shall not be deemed a shortage as set forth in Section 5.1(c), but in no event shall the quantity
delivered deviate from the quantity ordered by more than: [***].
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, AMAG acknowledges and agrees that Antares
shall only be responsible for producing and delivering to AMAG that portion (up to the entire quantity) of
Products and sample Products requested pursuant to a Purchase Order for which Antares or its Subcontractor
(as the case may be) possesses, at least [***] prior to the Delivery Date, a sufficient stock of inventory of
Prefilled Syringes necessary to

manufacture and deliver such number of Products and sample Products for which Antares or its Subcontractor (as the case may
be) has Prefilled Syringes in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Firm Order, and (B) as soon as practicable (and no
more than [***] following receipt of the Prefilled Syringes required for such Firm Order, Antares or its Subcontractor shall
manufacture and deliver the Products and sample Products in such order taking into account any Products and sample Products
manufactured and delivered pursuant to subsection (A).
(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, AMAG acknowledges and agrees that Antares
shall not be responsible for delay in the delivery of quantity of Products, sample Products or Trainers (as the

EXHIBIT 10.2
FIRST AMENDMENT TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT
This First Amendment (“Amendment”) to the Supply and Manufacturing Agreement dated April 1, 2017 between
Cerus Corporation (“Cerus”) and Porex Corporation (“Porex”) (the “Agreement”) is made this 22 day of June 2018.
RECITALS
A. Cerus and Porex have agreed to make certain changes to the raw material and process to develop
Components and such changes have resulted in a change to the cost and expense structure originally contemplated by
the Agreement;
B. Pursuant to Section 3 of the Agreement, Cerus and Porex have mutually agreed to temporarily modify the
pricing for Platelet Wafers set forth on Exhibit D and to proactively set a cost structure for non-production related work.
NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows:
1. New Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4, as set forth in Schedule 1 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the
Agreement (inserted between Exhibit A-5 and Exhibit B-1) and incorporated therein by reference. The parties
acknowledge and agree that Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4 set forth the revised specifications for Platelet
Wafers manufactured by Porex for Cerus (collectively, the “Revised Wafer Specifications”). Unless otherwise
agreed in writing, Porex shall continue to manufacture and produce Platelet Wafers using the existing
specifications for Platelet Wafers until Cerus gives written notice to Porex that Platelet Wafers shall be thereafter
manufactured in accordance with the Revised Wafer Specifications. References in the Agreement to
“Specifications” shall be interpreted to include the Revised Wafer Specifications, as applicable.
2. A new Exhibit D-1, as set forth in Schedule 2 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the Agreement and
incorporated therein by reference. As of April 1, 2018 and continuing until Cerus determines, in its sole discretion,
that the Protocol EPP-029-886 under which Porex is currently operating can be discontinued, the price for
Platelet Wafers shall be the prices set forth in Exhibit D-1. Upon Cerus’ determination that the Protocol EPP-029-
886 can be discontinued, Cerus shall provide written notice thereof to Porex, along with a new purchase order for
Platelet Wafers (the “New Pricing PO”). On and after the date of such notice, the “Pricing” table for Platelet
Wafers in Exhibit D, as of the date immediately preceding the date of this Amendment, shall be reinstated and
apply to Platelet Wafers that are produced pursuant to the New Pricing PO and were also produced after the date
of the written notice. References in Section 1.5.1 of the Agreement to “Exhibit D” shall be amended to include
“Exhibit D-1,” as applicable.
3. The penultimate sentence in Section 1.3 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
“In no event shall any Purchase Order: require delivery of more than [*] units of [*] and [*] units of [*] in any [*] (the
“Porex Capacity Limitations”).”
4. A new Section 1.5.3 shall be added to the Agreement as follows:1.5.3 Porex will invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed by Porex during the prior month. Unless
otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be
due [*] days following Cerus’ receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax
Identification Number will be included on each invoice.
Cerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from
Porex’s completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in
the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered
accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to
Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make
the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus. For disputed
invoices or the disputed portion of an invoice, Cerus shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Porex, in writing,
within [*] days, a description of the disputed amounts. Cerus and Porex shall negotiate in a timely, good faith
manner to resolve billing queries. Cerus will not have responsibility to pay for identified errors, incomplete or
inaccurate items (collectively the “invoice errors”) which result in increases to previously invoiced amounts if the
aforementioned invoice errors are communicated to Cerus later than [*] days from the original invoice date.
5. A new Section 3a shall be added to the Agreement as follows:
“3a Non-Production Related Work. From time to time, Cerus may submit to Porex written work orders
substantially in the form of Schedule 3 that specify development activities, engineering analysis, part, material
and/or fixture design and development, or other services or activities that Cerus requests Porex to perform that
are not activities or services that are necessary for the then-current manufacture and production of Components
for Cerus under the Agreement (collectively, as defined in each work order, the “ Services”). Each work order
shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance
schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services. Upon acceptance of a work order by
Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a “Statement of Work.” If Porex begins to perform services
under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses
incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex’s use of
the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to
perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the
completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any
conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of
Work expressly refers to the Parties’ intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of
Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.”
6. A new section titled “Pricing for Non-Production Related Work Orders from Cerus” is added to Exhibit D as set
forth in Schedule 2 attached. Such pricing, upon mutual agreement of the Parties, shall apply to any Statement of
Work mutually agreed by the Parties pursuant to Section 3a.
7. No other changes are made to the Agreement, including without limitation, the original Exhibit D, and the
Agreement, the Plasma Disk pricing and related information as set forth in Exhibit D remain the same.
Except as amended herein, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this First Amendment to be signed, all as of the date
first written above.
