assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to its assets or business, provided,
however, that the obligations of the Consultant are personal and shall not be assigned by Consultant.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and other good and valuable consideration, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

2. No Control by the Company. The Parties agree that CONSULTANT shall use its own judgment as to the time, place, details, and means by which
CONSULTANT will accomplish the results of CONSULTANT’s services under this Agreement, that CONSULTANT is not required to work set
hours of the day or week established by the Company or perform specific services in a sequence determined by the Company, and that nothing

however, that CONSULTANT is expected to provide the services contemplated by this Agreement in a timely and competent manner in order to
meet the needs and expectations of the Company.
3. Independent Contractor. The Parties expressly intend and agree that CONSULTANT is acting as an independent contractor and not as an

of this Agreement, developed or created by the CONSULTANT. CONSULTANT acknowledges and agrees that any and all Proprietary Information
of REIT is the property of REIT.

Technologies, Ltd (hereinafter the “Company”), a Delaware corporation whose address is 501 1 st Ave N., Suite 901, St. Petersburg, FL 33701 and
Timothy Cabrera (hereinafter the “Consultant”) , an individual whose address is 11718 SE Federal Hwy., Suite 372, Hobe Sound, FL 33455
(individually, a “Party”; collectively, the “Parties”). This Agreement is non-exclusive.
RECITALS
WHEREAS, the Company has asked to retain Consultant to provide various services to the Company as agreed to by both parties and
outlined in Section 3; and
WHEREAS, the Consultant has advised the Company of its willingness and desire to provide such services as outlined in Section 3 and
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. CONDITIONS. This Agreement will not take effect, and Consultant will have no obligation to provide any service whatsoever, unless and until
the Company sends a signed copy of this Agreement to Consultant (either by mail or facsimile copy). The Company shall be truthful with
Consultant in regard to any relevant material regarding the Company, verbally or otherwise, or this entire Agreement will terminate and all
consideration paid shall be forfeited without further notice.
Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees to cooperate with Consultant in carrying out the purposes of this Agreement,
keep Consultant informed of any developments of importance pertaining to the Company’s business and abide by this Agreement in its entirety.
2. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1)
year or until Consultant completes the services requested. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event
of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the
terminated Party.
3. CONSULTING SERVICES. During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will perform the services described below (the “Consulting Services”)
for the Company.
(a) Transactional Business
(i) Further development of the business plan for the Company’s subsidiaries; and
1 ____ ____(ii) Seek and advise the Company on the acquisition of potential products for the Company’s subsidiaries; and
(iii) Assist in negotiating acquisition or merger consideration as required by the Company; and
(iv) Setting up meetings between the Company and acquisition candidates and arranging other liaisons between them; and
(v) Assist the Company with certain day to day tasks of managing the Company’s subsidiaries; and
(vi) Assist in the sale of any inventory held by any of the Company’s subsidiaries; and
(vii) Assist in the sale of any future products acquired, licensed or developed by the Company and or its subsidiaries.
4. STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE. Consultant shall devote such time and efforts to the affairs of the Company as is reasonably necessary to
render the services contemplated by this Agreement. Consultant is not responsible for the performance of any services that may be rendered
hereunder if the Company fails to provide the requested information in writing prior thereto. The services of Consultant shall not include the
rendering of any legal opinions or the performance of any work that is in the ordinary purview of a certified public accountant. Consultant cannot
guarantee results on behalf of the Company but shall use commercially reasonable efforts in providing the services listed above. Consultant’s duty
is to identify prospective acquisition/joint venture companies for the Company. Consultant will in no way act as a “broker-dealer” under state
securities laws. Because all final decisions pertaining to any particular investment are to be made by the Company, the Company may be required to
communicate directly with potential acquisition/joint venture prospective companies.
5. COMPENSATION TO CONSULTANT. As Consultant’s entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay
Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any
inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant
shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (“Note”) issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (“Jetco”) on November
30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event
the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco
Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for
services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition.
The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority
with respect to the Consultant’s performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts
paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law.
Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting
contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker’s compensation insurance on the Consultant’s behalf. The Consultant
agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including
obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement.
The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and
interest.
2 ____ ____6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Consultant and the Company acknowledge that each will have access to proprietary information
regarding the business operations of the other and agree to keep all such information secret and confidential and not to use or disclose any such
information to any individual or organization without the non-disclosing Parties prior written consent. It is hereby agreed that from time to time
Consultant and the Company may designate certain disclosed information as confidential for purposes of this Agreement.
7. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the “Indemnified
Party”) from and against any and all claims, damages, and liabilities, including any and all expense and costs, legal or otherwise, caused by the
negligent act or omission of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in the investigation
and defense of any claim, demand, or action arising out of the work performed under this Agreement; including breach of the Indemnifying Party of
this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities caused by the sole negligence of the Indemnified
Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees.
The Indemnified Party shall notify promptly the Indemnifying Party of the existence of any claim, demand, or other matter to which the
Indemnifying Party’s indemnification obligations would apply, and shall give them a reasonable opportunity to settle or defend the same at their
own expense and with counsel of their own selection, provided that the Indemnified Party shall at all times also have the right to fully participate in
the defense. If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after this notice, fails to take appropriate steps to settle or defend the claim, demand,
or the matter, the Indemnified Party shall, upon written notice, have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake such settlement or defense and to
compromise or settle the claim, demand, or other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk, of the Indemnifying Party.
The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Article shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, and
heirs of the Parties.

Agreement, Consultant will:

ARTICLE 1. EXERCISE.

in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder a number of Warrant Shares computed using the following formula:

Stock is listed, in each case for the fifteen trading days ending five trading days prior to the date of determination of fair market value;

consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares, the Exercise Price shall be proportionately increased and the
number of Shares shall be proportionately decreased.

the Shares if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event. The
Company or its successor shall promptly issue to Holder an amendment to this Warrant setting forth the number and kind of such new
securities or other property issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant as a result of such reclassification, exchange,

Warrant.12

reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 2) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into
another corporation, then as a part of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the Holder shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon the exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities and property of the Company, or of

Shares if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reorganization, merger or consolidation.

necessary or desirable by Aduro.7. Nonsolicitation. From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the “ Restricted Period”), Consultant shall
not, without Aduro’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate
employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be

provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this
Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof. If during the term of this Agreement any situation or
circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise
participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company’s
General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the

of law principles of California or any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them with respect to the
subject matter hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not supersede or in modify in anyway any other written agreement between the
parties. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing signed by both of the parties hereto. The obligations of
Consultant as set forth herein, other than Consultant’s obligations to perform the Project, shall survive the termination of Consultant’s engagement with
Aduro. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain effective and
enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Consultant. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but
one agreement.ADURO BIOTECH, INC. CONSULTANT
