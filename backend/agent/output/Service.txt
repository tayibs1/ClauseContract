WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the Adviser serves pursuant to advisory or subadvisory agreements (“Advisory Agreements”) as investment
advisor or subadvisor to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and/or
separate accounts not required to be so registered (collectively, “Accounts”); and
WHEREAS, the Adviser desires to engage FASC to provide certain services to Adviser in connection with the services to be
provided by the Adviser under the Advisory Agreements;
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The

Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section;
provided that the failure to give such notice, or any delay in giving such notice, shall not lessen the obligation of the Adviser to
indemnify FASC except to the extent it results in actual prejudice. The Adviser shall have the option, by notice to FASC, to assume
the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. In the event such notice is given, the Adviser shall

claim, the Adviser shall not be obligated to indemnify FASC for any further legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or
defending such claim, except those incurred at the request of the Adviser or its counsel. FASC shall in no event compromise or settle

(c) The Adviser and FASC are each hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of liability set forth in the Declaration of
Trust of the other party. Each party agrees that the obligations of the other party pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited solely to

WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC have entered into the Amendment to Services Agreement dated as of March 30, 2009 (the
“Amendment”), pursuant to which the Services indicated in Exhibit A to the Services Agreement were amended solely with respect to Accounts
that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, to provide that, as part of the administration and risk management services

with the following:
“3. Equity Trading and Transaction Settlement . The equity trading desks execute buy and sell order based on instructions
provided by affiliated advisers. The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders,
find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the
broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies.
4. Fundamental Analysis . The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific
companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management,
on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade
journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary
analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser.
5. Quantitative Analysis . Quantitative analysts develop and apply financial models designed to enable equity portfolio
managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, assess relative risk and enhance
performance relative to benchmarks and peers.
To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment
company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as “investment advisory services” for purposes of Section 5(b) of
the Agreement.”

Second Amendment with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser does not trade in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity
investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account. This Second Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This Second Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be
deemed to be an original copy of this Second Amendment and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.

that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises for all comparable device payment plan agreement receivables that it services for itself
or others according to the Servicing Procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer’s obligations will include:
(i) collecting and applying all payments made on, or credits applied to, the Receivables and any other amounts received related to
the Depositor Transferred Property;
(ii) investigating delinquencies;
(iii) sending invoices and notices and responding to inquiries of Obligors;

Files; and

under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.
(b) Collection of Payments; Extensions and Amendments . The Servicer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or advisable
to collect each Receivable in accordance with this Agreement and the Servicing Procedures using commercially reasonable care and diligence and
in any event, with no less care or diligence than the Servicer exercises in collecting other similar receivables or obligations owed to it and its
Affiliates. All payments remitted by an Obligor to the Servicer in respect of a Receivable, any release of a security deposit, and any application of a
Credit granted to a customer by Verizon Wireless (other than applications of payments and credits granted to an Obligor under a Receivable in
respect of cancellations, prepayments, invoicing errors or in connection with an Upgrade Offer as described under Section
7
Source: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/20203.12(b)) will be applied to the related account by the Servicer based on invoice aging, so that such amounts are applied to the oldest invoiced
balances first, then the second oldest invoiced balances, etc., and finally to current billing amounts, in each case, in the order described below:

• service and all other charges, including, but not limited to, insurance premium payments and purchases (including accessories)
billed to the account, other than amounts due under any device payment plan agreement, including any Receivable; and

payment plan agreements related to a single account, will be applied in the order in which such device payment plan agreements
were originated with the most recent device payment plan agreement being paid last.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Transaction Document, the process for application of payments remitted by an Obligor to
the Servicer in respect of a Receivable, releases of security deposits, and applications of Credits granted to an Obligor under a Receivable by
Verizon Wireless (other than those credits granted to an Obligor in respect of an Upgrade Offer as described under Section 3.12(b)) described in the

amounts applicable to the Receivables (i) is also applicable to any device payment plan agreements that the Servicer services for itself and others
and (ii) so long as Cellco is the Servicer, does not have a material adverse effect on the Noteholders. In addition, the Servicer may waive late
payment charges or other fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing a Receivable. The Servicer may grant extensions, refunds,
rebates or adjustments on any Receivable or amend any Receivable according to the Servicing Procedures. However, if the Servicer (i) grants

the remaining Principal Balance under a Receivable or any portion thereof and/or as a result, the monthly payments due thereunder, or (iii) modifies,
supplements, amends or revises a Receivable to grant the Obligor under such Receivable a contractual right to upgrade the related Device, it will
acquire the affected Receivable solely as described under Section 3.3, unless it is required to take the action by Law. In addition, if the Marketing
Agent or the Servicer (x) applies a payment or grants a credit to an Obligor with respect to cancellations, prepayments or invoicing errors the
Servicer may apply such credits either directly to the applicable device payment plan agreement or in accordance with its customary payment
application procedures set forth above and (y) applies a payment or grants a credit to an Obligor under a Receivable in connection with an Upgrade
Offer as set forth in Section 3.12(b), the Servicer will apply such credits directly to the applicable device payment plan agreement and will not apply

determine whether the pool of Receivables to be held by the Issuer as of the related Cutoff Date, including any Additional Receivables to be
acquired, satisfies the Credit Enhancement Test and each Pool Composition Test. If the pool of Receivables does not satisfy all of the Pool
Composition Tests, the Administrator may identify Receivables in the pool as Temporarily Excluded Receivables so that the remaining Receivables
in the pool will satisfy all of the Pool Composition Tests; provided , that the Administrator may only deem Receivables to be Temporarily Excluded
Receivables if the Overcollateralization Target Amount is reached as of the close of business on such date of determination, without taking into

of the Pool Composition Tests either will remain satisfied or will not be adversely affected.

separately agreed to under the Marketing Agent Agency Agreement.
(d) Covenants of the Marketing Agent . The Marketing Agent will not (i) make any Upgrade Offers that waive any obligations of an
Obligor under the related device payment plan agreement, (ii) eliminate the obligation of Verizon Wireless to pay off a device payment plan
agreement if an Obligor satisfies the related terms and conditions thereof, or (iii) eliminate or impair any third party beneficiary rights of an assignee
under an Upgrade Offer, including the right of such assignee to enforce Verizon Wireless’ payment obligation under any Upgrade Offer.
Section 3.12 Termination of Upgrade Programs; Credits Related to Upgrade Programs.
(a) To the extent any Upgrade Offer has not been terminated and an Obligor satisfies all of the terms and conditions of such Upgrade Offer
in respect of a Receivable, and (i) the Marketing Agent fails to make, or to cause the related Originator to make, the required Upgrade Payment into
the Collection Account as set forth in Section 4.3(g) and (ii) the Parent Support Provider fails to make any required Upgrade Payments as set forth
in Section 1 of the Parent Support Agreement, the Servicer and the Marketing Agent shall terminate all Upgrade Offers within ten (10) Business
Days after the date the Parent Support Provider received notice from the Indenture Trustee that an Upgrade Payment was due under Section 1 of
the Parent Support Agreement.
(b) If the Marketing Agent, the relevant Originator and the Parent Support Provider fail to make such Upgrade Payments with respect to an
Upgrade Offer, (i) the Servicer shall deliver the notice to Obligors pursuant to Section 3.13 with respect to such Obligors’ recoupment rights against
Verizon Wireless, and (ii) notwithstanding any failure to deliver such notice, (x) if Cellco is still the Servicer, the Servicer shall give a monthly credit
to the Obligor against amounts owing with respect to the new device payment plan agreement resulting from the Upgrade Offer, in an amount equal
to the amount due that month under the original device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable, or (y) if Cellco is no longer the Servicer,
Cellco, (1) if required, shall give such monthly credit to the Obligor only if Cellco has received notice from the Servicer that the Obligor has paid the
amount due in the prior month under the original device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable, and (2) shall cooperate with any Successor
Servicer to properly bill and credit such Obligor’s account with respect to the Receivable and the new device payment plan agreement related to the
Upgrade Offer. Any such monthly credit granted to an Obligor shall be applied directly against the monthly payment due on the new device
payment plan agreement and will not be applied in accordance with the Servicer’s customary payment application procedures pursuant to its
Servicing Procedures, if different. For the avoidance of doubt, if during such time as Cellco is no longer the Servicer, an Obligor remits the full
amount due under the related new device payment plan agreement, but does not make a payment to the new Servicer for the original device
payment plan agreement, a portion of such amount equal to the amount of the monthly credit granted to such Obligor resulting from the Upgrade
Offer in respect of the original device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable shall be paid by Cellco to the new Servicer. In such case, to the
extent that all other amounts owed on the related account are current, the Servicer will not consider such account or payments
15
Source: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020under the new device payment plan agreement to be Delinquent. In addition, regardless of whether Cellco continues to be the Servicer of any
Receivable for which the terms and conditions of an Upgrade Offer (other than the requirement that the Marketing Agent remit, or cause the related
Originator to remit, an Upgrade Payment for such Receivable) were satisfied by the related Obligor and for which the Marketing Agent, the related
Originator and the Parent Support Provider failed to make the related Upgrade Payment, Cellco shall remit any Collections received on such
Receivable to the Collection Account in the time period in which it would have been otherwise obligated to do so.
Section 3.13 Notices to Obligors .
Within ten (10) days following the earlier to occur of (i) a ratings downgrade by each of the Rating Agencies of Verizon to below
investment grade, or (ii) a Servicer Termination Event, the Servicer will send a notice to all Obligors indicating (a) that their Receivables have been
assigned to the Issuer, and (b)(x) if Cellco has not been removed as Servicer, that the Obligors shall continue to make their payments as they had
previously, or (y) if Cellco has been removed as Servicer, the name of the Successor Servicer and any new instructions with respect to their
payments. In addition, if the Servicer Termination Event was as a result of the failure of the Marketing Agent to satisfy its obligation to make, or to
cause the related Originators to make, required Upgrade Payments pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)(y), then Cellco shall also send a notice to (i) all
Obligors who have a continuing right to an upgrade, indicating that Cellco has recently failed to make the necessary prepayments with respect to
one or more of its customers in connection with an Upgrade Offer, and that if any Obligor chooses to upgrade and Cellco fails to make the related
Upgrade Payment with respect to them, such Obligor will still be required to make payments on his or her original device payment plan agreement,
but that such Obligor will have a corresponding recoupment right against his or her new device payment plan agreement with Verizon Wireless, and
(ii) all Obligors who had initiated upgrades under an Upgrade Offer, indicating that Cellco had failed to make the relevant Upgrade Payment, and
stating that such Obligors will continue to have an obligation to make payments on their original device payment plan agreements, but will have a
corresponding right of recoupment against their new device payment plan agreements with Verizon Wireless.

Acquisition Account in excess of such amount in any Permitted Investments, other than (x) any investments set forth in clauses (b) or (c) of the
definition of Permitted Investments that are held by or at the Indenture Trustee or (y) any investments set forth in clause (e) of the definition

(i) If Cellco is the Servicer and (x) Verizon’s long-term unsecured debt is rated equal to or higher than “Baa2” by Moody’s and “A”
by S&P (the “Monthly Deposit Required Ratings ”), (y) Verizon guarantees certain payment obligations of Cellco, as Servicer, as provided
in the Parent Support Agreement and (z) no Servicer Termination Event has occurred, the Servicer may deposit Collections into the
Collection Account on the second Business Day before each Payment Date.
(ii) For as long as (x) Verizon’s long-term unsecured debt is not rated at least the Monthly Deposit Required Ratings, (y) Verizon
does not guaranty certain payment obligations of Cellco, as Servicer or (z) a Servicer Termination Event occurs, the Servicer will (1)
deposit into the Collection Account all amounts received and applied as interest or principal on the Receivables within two (2) Business
Days after identification of receipt of good funds and (2) provide a written report (which may be electronically submitted) to the Indenture

(ii) Acquisition Amounts for the
19
Source: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020Payment Date, exceeds the amounts deposited under Section 4.3(b) for the Collection Period, Cellco will deposit an amount equal to the excess into
the Collection Account on the second Business Day before the Payment Date. If, for any Payment Date, the amounts deposited under Section
4.3(b) for the Collection Period exceed the sum of (i) Collections for the Collection Period, plus (ii) Acquisition Amounts for the Payment Date, the
Indenture Trustee or the Note Paying Agent will pay to Cellco from Available Funds in the Collection Account an amount equal to the excess

acknowledge that the failure of the Marketing Agent to deposit, or to cause the related Originator to deposit, into the Collection Account the
related Upgrade Payment or otherwise to pay off the Receivable would constitute a breach by the related Originator of its obligation to the Obligor
under the Upgrade Contract and that this breach would adversely affect the value of the Receivables, and give the Obligor a claim in recoupment
against the related Originator and a right to offset that claim against the amounts that the Obligor would owe to the related Originator under the
new device payment plan agreement (each such agreement, a “ New Upgrade DPP”) entered into by the related Originator (or its agent, on its
behalf) pursuant to the Upgrade Contract. The parties hereto intend that the payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator of the
Upgrade Payment as provided in this Section 4.3(g) shall extinguish such Obligor’s claim in recoupment against the related Originator and the
Obligor’s right to offset the amount of that claim against the amounts that the Obligor would owe under the New Upgrade DPP contemporaneously
with such Upgrade Payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator. The parties hereto also intend that the payment by the Marketing
Agent or the related Originator of the Upgrade

owe under the new device payment plan agreement entered into by such Verizon Originator (or its agent, on its behalf) pursuant to the Upgrade
Contract as described in that Section 2.2.1 contemporaneously with such Upgrade Payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator.

the Collection Account the related Credit Payment within two (2) Business Days after identification that such Credit was applied to an Obligor
account; provided , that if the conditions set forth in Section 4.3(b)(i) are satisfied, the Marketing Agent shall deposit, or shall cause the related
Originator to deposit, such amounts into the Collection Account on the second Business Day before the Payment Date related to the Collection
Period in which such Credit was applied to an Obligor account.
(i) Deposit of Assumption of Liability Payments . If an Originator or the Servicer allows a device payment plan agreement that is a
Receivable to be transferred to a new Obligor, the Marketing Agent shall acquire such Receivable and deposit, or cause the related Originator to

Indenture Trustee and, accordingly, Article VI of the Indenture will be inapplicable to the Indenture Trustee solely in its capacity as
Successor Servicer and (B) may appoint as Servicer any one of its Affiliates, but the Indenture Trustee, in its capacity as Successor
Servicer, will be liable for the actions and omissions of such Affiliate. If the Indenture Trustee is unwilling or legally unable to act as
Successor Servicer, it will appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an institution having a net worth of not less
than $50,000,000 whose regular business and operations includes the servicing of consumer receivables and can accommodate the
servicing of device payment plan agreements, as successor to the Servicer under this Agreement. The Indenture Trustee will be released
from its obligations as Successor Servicer on the date that a new Servicer accepts its engagement as Successor Servicer.
(b) Acceptance of Engagement . The Successor Servicer will accept its engagement by assuming the Servicer’s obligations under this
Agreement or entering into an amendment to this Agreement or a new servicing agreement on substantially the same terms as this Agreement, in a
form acceptable to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee. The Successor Servicer will deliver a copy of the assumption, amendment or new
servicing agreement to the other parties and the Indenture Trustee. The Successor Servicer (other than the Indenture Trustee as Successor
Servicer) will accept its engagement as Administrator according to Section 3.5 of the Administration Agreement. Promptly following a Successor
Servicer’s acceptance of its engagement, the Indenture Trustee will notify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Secured Parties of the engagement.
On receipt of a notice of engagement, the Issuer will promptly notify the Rating Agencies and the Asset Representations Reviewer, and the Owner
Trustee will promptly notify the Certificateholders. Any Successor Servicer will agree to provide to Cellco any information relating to payments
received from Obligors (including any payments received on a Receivable that was the subject of an upgrade for which none of the Marketing
Agent, the related Originator or the Parent Support Provider deposited a required Upgrade Payment),

account for which none of the Marketing Agent, the related Originator or the Parent Support Provider remitted an Upgrade Payment, as set forth in
Section 3.12(b). Any Successor Servicer will agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the legal, regulatory, privacy and data protection
policies set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto to the extent such Successor Servicer receives information from Cellco or any of its Affiliates relating
to the Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, no Successor Servicer will be required to assume or undertake the obligations of Cellco, as Servicer,
under Sections 3.4 and 4.7 of the Master Trust Receivables Transfer Agreement or Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of this Agreement. No Successor Servicer
shall have any liability for the acts or omissions of any predecessor Servicer.
(c) Compensation of Successor Servicer . The Indenture Trustee may make arrangements for the compensation of the Successor Servicer
out of Collections as it and the Successor Servicer may agree. In addition to the Servicing Fee, on the date of its appointment as Successor Servicer,
such Successor Servicer will receive a fee of $150,000 payable pursuant to Section 8.2(c) or 8.2(e) of the Indenture, as applicable, and thereafter, will
be entitled to the Additional Successor Servicer Fee, which will be paid in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section 8.2(c) or 8.2(e) of the
Indenture, as applicable.
(d) Transfer of Authority . On the effective date of the Servicer’s resignation or termination or the later date that the Servicer stops
performing its obligations, and solely to the extent the Successor Servicer is an entity other than the Indenture Trustee, all rights and obligations of
the Servicer under this Agreement and of the Administrator under the Administration Agreement will become the rights and obligations of the
Successor Servicer, including as successor Administrator. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the resignation or removal of Cellco as Servicer will not
result in the termination of Cellco’s duties as Marketing Agent and (y) if the Indenture Trustee is the Successor Servicer, Cellco will continue to act
as Administrator under the Administration Agreement, to the extent it is able to continue to perform thereunder pursuant to the terms of the
Administration Agreement.
(e) Authority of Issuer and Indenture Trustee . The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee are authorized to execute and deliver, on behalf of the

Servicer will not be obligated to provide, license or assign its processes, procedures, models, servicing software or other applications to any
Successor Servicer or any third party, or provide anything covered by a restriction on transfer or assignment or a confidentiality agreement or
otherwise restricted by legal, regulatory, privacy or data protection policies.
(c) Expenses of Servicing Transition. All reasonable expenses incurred by the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the
Successor Servicer in connection with (i) the transition of servicing rights and obligations to the Successor Servicer and (ii) amending this
Agreement or entering into an assumption agreement or new agreement to reflect a succession of the Servicer will be paid by the resigning or
terminated Servicer on receipt of an invoice in reasonable detail.
Section 7.6 Merger, Consolidation, Succession or Assignment . Any Person (a) into which the Servicer is merged or consolidated, (b)
resulting from a merger or consolidation to which the Servicer is a party, (c) succeeding to the Servicer’s business or (d) that is an Affiliate of the
Servicer to whom the Servicer has assigned this Agreement, will be the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement. Within fifteen (15)

obligations under this Agreement and each Transaction Document to which the Servicer is a party (unless the assumption happens by operation of
Law), (ii) deliver to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that the

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Delinquency Trigger with respect to any Collection Period, the Servicer will promptly send to the
Administrator, the Indenture Trustee and each Noteholder (and to each applicable Clearing Agency for distribution to Note Owners in accordance
with the rules of such Clearing Agency) as of the most recent Record Date a notice describing (i) the occurrence of the Delinquency Trigger, and
including reasonably detailed calculations thereof, and (ii) the rights of the Noteholders and Note Owners regarding an Asset Representations
Review (including a description of the method by which Noteholders and Note Owners may contact the Indenture Trustee in order to request a
Noteholder vote in respect of an Asset Representations Review). In connection with the foregoing, upon request from the Servicer, the Indenture
Trustee shall provide a list of the Noteholders of record as of the most recent Record Date. The notice provided under this Section 11.1 (a) and the
related 10-D that is filed are the only notices that will be provided to Noteholders concerning whether the Delinquency Trigger has occurred.
(b) If the Indenture Trustee notifies the Servicer pursuant to 14.2 of the Indenture that sufficient Noteholders have voted within the
required time to initiate an Asset Representations Review of all 60-Day Delinquent Receivables by the Asset Representations Reviewer pursuant to
the Asset Representations Review Agreement, then the Servicer shall:
(i) promptly notify the Asset Representations Reviewer and the Indenture Trustee of the number of 60-Day Delinquent
Receivables;
(ii) within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Servicer of that notice from the Indenture Trustee, render reasonable assistance,
including granting access to copies of any underlying documents and Receivable Files and all other relevant documents, to the Asset
Representations Reviewer to facilitate the performance of a review of all 60-Day Delinquent Receivables, pursuant to Section 3.3(a) of the
Asset Representations Review Agreement, in order to verify compliance with the representations and warranties made to the Issuer by the
Depositor; provided, that the Servicer shall use its best efforts to redact any materials provided to the Asset Representations Reviewer in
order to remove any Personally Identifiable Information without changing the meaning or usefulness of the Review Materials; and
(iii) provide such other reasonable assistance to the Asset Representations Reviewer as it requests in order to facilitate its Asset
Representations Review of the 60-Day Delinquent Receivables pursuant to the Asset Representations Review Agreement.
Section 11.2 Dispute Resolution .
47
Source: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020(a) If (i) the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee (acting on behalf of the Noteholders) or (ii) any Noteholder or Verified Note Owner requests, by
written notice to (x) the Indenture Trustee (which will be forwarded to the related Originator or the Servicer as applicable) or (y) the related
Originator or the Servicer (in the case of Receivables transferred by the Master Trust) (any such party making a request, the “ Requesting Party ”),
that a Receivable be reacquired or acquired due to an alleged breach of the Eligibility Representation with respect to that Receivable as set forth in
Section 3.3 of the Originator Receivables Transfer Agreement or Section 3.3 of the Master Trust Receivables Transfer Agreement, respectively, and
the request has not been fulfilled or otherwise resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Requesting Party within one-hundred eighty (180)
days of the receipt of such request by the related Originator or the Servicer (in the case of Receivables transferred by the Master Trust), then the
Requesting Party will have the right to refer the matter, at its discretion, to either mediation (including non-binding arbitration) or third-party
binding arbitration pursuant to this Section 11.2. Dispute resolution to resolve reacquisition or acquisition requests will be available regardless of
whether Noteholders and Note Owners voted to direct an Asset Representations Review or whether the Delinquency Trigger occurred. The
Depositor will provide written direction to the Indenture Trustee instructing it to notify the Requesting Party (directly if the Requesting Party is a
Noteholder and through the applicable Clearing Agency for distribution to such Requesting Party, if the Requesting Party is a Note Owner, in
accordance with the rules of such Clearing Agency) no later than five (5) Business Days after the end of the 180-day period of the date when the
180-day period ends without resolution by the appropriate party, which written direction will specify the identity of the Requesting Party and the
date as of which that 180-day period shall have ended; provided , that the Indenture Trustee shall have no other obligation whatsoever to
participate in any dispute resolution, mediation or arbitration to determine if a reacquisition or acquisition request has been resolved within the
applicable 180-day period. The Requesting Party must provide notice of its intention to refer the matter to mediation, to refer the matter to
arbitration, or to institute a legal proceeding, to the Depositor within thirty (30) days after the delivery of notice of the end of the 180-day period.
The Depositor will participate in the resolution method selected by the Requesting Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Owner Trustee shall have
no obligation whatsoever to participate in any dispute resolution, mediation or arbitration to determine if a reacquisition or acquisition request has
been resolved within the applicable 180-day period. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Indenture Trustee does not agree to pursue or otherwise be
involved in resolving any reacquisition or acquisition request or dispute resolution proceeding, the related Noteholders or Verified Note Owners
may independently pursue dispute resolution in respect of such reacquisition or acquisition. If the Indenture Trustee brings a dispute resolution
action based on Noteholder direction to do so, the “Requesting Party” shall be deemed to be the requesting Note Owners (or the party to the
arbitration) for purposes of the dispute resolution proceeding, including allocation of fees and expenses. The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable
for any costs, expenses and/or liabilities allocated to a Requesting Party as part of the dispute resolution proceeding. Further, the Indenture Trustee
shall be under no obligation under this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or otherwise to monitor reacquisition or acquisition activity or
to independently determine which reacquisition or acquisition requests remain unresolved after one-hundred eighty (180) days.
(b) If the Requesting Party selects mediation (including non-binding arbitration) as the resolution method, the following provisions will
apply:
48
Source: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020(i) The mediation will be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Mediation Procedures in effect on the date the arbitration is filed.
(ii) The mediator will be impartial, knowledgeable about and experienced with the laws of the State of New York and an attorney
specializing in commercial litigation with at least 15 years of experience and who will be appointed from a list of neutrals maintained by
JAMS. Upon being supplied a list of at least 10 potential mediators by JAMS each party will have the right to exercise two peremptory
challenges within fourteen (14) days and to rank the remaining potential mediators in order of preference JAMS will select the mediator
from the remaining attorneys on the list respecting the preference choices of the parties to the extent possible.
(iii) The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to begin the mediation within thirty (30) days of the selection of the
mediator and to conclude the mediation within sixty (60) days of the start of the mediation.
(iv) The fees and expenses of the mediation will be allocated as mutually agreed by the parties as part of the mediation.
(c) If the Requesting Party selects binding arbitration as the resolution method, the following provisions will apply:
(i) The arbitration will be administered by the AAA pursuant its Arbitration Rules in effect on the date the arbitration is filed.
(ii) The arbitral panel will consist of three members, (i) one to be appointed by the Requesting Party within five (5) Business Days
of providing notice to the Depositor of its selection of arbitration, (ii) one to be appointed by the Depositor within five (5) Business Days
of that appointment and (iii) the third, who will preside over the panel, to be chosen by the two party-appointed arbitrators within five (5)
Business Days of the second appointment. If any party fails to appoint an arbitrator or the two party-appointed arbitrators fail to appoint
the third within the stated time periods, then the appointments will be made by AAA pursuant to the Arbitration Rules. In each such case,
each arbitrator will be impartial, knowledgeable about and experienced with the laws of the State of New York and an attorney specializing
in commercial litigation with at least 15 years of experience.
(iii) Each arbitrator will be independent and will abide by the Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes in effect as of
the date of this Agreement. Prior to accepting an appointment, each arbitrator must promptly disclose any circumstances likely to create a
reasonable inference of bias or conflict of interest or likely to preclude completion of the hearings within the prescribed time schedule.
Any arbitrator may be removed by AAA for cause consisting of actual bias, conflict of interest or other serious potential for conflict.
(iv) After consulting with the parties, the arbitral panel will devise procedures and deadlines for the arbitration, to the extent not
already agreed to by the parties, with the goal of expediting the proceeding and completing the arbitration within ninety (90)
49
Source: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020days after appointment. The arbitral panel will have the authority to schedule, hear, and determine any and all motions, including
dispositive and discovery motions, in accordance with then-prevailing New York law (including prehearing and post hearing motions), and
will do so on the motion of any party to the arbitration.
(v) Notwithstanding whatever other discovery may be available under the Rules, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, each
party to the arbitration will be presumptively limited to the following discovery in the arbitration: (A) four witness depositions not to
exceed five hours, and (B) one set of interrogations, document requests, and requests for admissions; provided that the arbitral panel will
have the ability to grant the parties, or either of them, additional discovery to the extent that the arbitral panel determines good cause is
shown that such additional discovery is reasonable and necessary.
(vi) The arbitral panel will make its final determination no later than ninety (90) days after appointment. The arbitral panel will
resolve the dispute in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. The arbitral
panel will not have the power to award punitive damages or consequential damages in any arbitration conducted by them. In its final
determination, the arbitral panel will determine and award the costs of the arbitration (including the fees of the arbitral panel, cost of any
record or transcript of the arbitration, and administrative fees) and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the parties as determined by the arbitral
panel in its reasonable discretion. The determination in any binding arbitration of the arbitral panel will be in writing and counterpart
copies will be promptly delivered to the parties. The determination will be final and non-appealable and may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction.
(vii) By selecting binding arbitration, the selecting party is giving up the right to sue in court, including the right to a trial by jury.
(viii) No person may bring class or collective claims in arbitration even if the Arbitration Rules would allow them.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the arbitral panel may award money or injunctive relief in favor of the individual party
seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
(d) The following provisions will apply to both mediations and arbitrations:
(i) Any mediation or arbitration will be held in New York, New York; and
(ii) The details and/or existence of any unfulfilled reacquisition or acquisition request, any informal meetings, mediations or
arbitration proceedings conducted under this Section 11.2, including all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written,
made in the course of the parties’ attempt to informally resolve an unfulfilled reacquisition or acquisition request, and any discovery taken
in connection with any arbitration, will be confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any
mediation, arbitration or litigation, or other proceeding (including
50
Source: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020any proceeding under this Section 11.2). This information will be kept strictly confidential and will not be disclosed or discussed with any
third party (excluding a party’s attorneys, experts, accountants and other agents and representatives, as reasonably required in
connection with any resolution procedure under this Section 11.2), except as otherwise required by law, regulatory requirement or court
order. If any party to a resolution procedure receives a subpoena or other request for information from a third party (other than a
governmental regulatory body) for such confidential information, the recipient will promptly notify the other party to the resolution
procedure and will provide the other party with the opportunity to object to the production of its confidential information.

obligations and duties of the Adviser under this Agreement. Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder or

to the Trust or
3
acting on any business of the Trust (other than services or business in connection with the Adviser's duties hereunder), to be rendering
such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director, officer, employee, shareholder or agent, or one under the control or
direction of the Adviser, even though paid by it. The Adviser is responsible for any information that it provides to the Trust for inclusion in
the prospectus and/or statement of additional information of the Fund. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its

notice to the other party. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser such compensation as may be payable

(a) By Constellation . Constellation agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the HOF Entities and their respective
shareholders, partners, officers, directors, employees, successors, assigns, representatives, servants and agents (collectively, the “ HOF Entity
Indemnified Persons ”) from and against, and Constellation waives any claim for contribution or indemnity against any HOF Entity Indemnified
Person with respect to, any and all claims, suits, actions, claims, monetary damages, losses, liabilities, fines, fees, penalties, costs and expenses
(“Losses ”), and all reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, including court costs and expert witness fees and costs, incurred in connection with
Losses and/or enforcement of this Agreement (“ Indemnified Losses ”) resulting from or arising out of (i) the use or display by the HOF Entities (or
either of them) of Constellation’s Marks or the Co-Branded Center for Excellence Logos (in each case, as permitted by this Agreement); (ii) the
promotion, advertising, distribution and/or sale of any Products & Services by Constellation pursuant to any license granted by the HOF Entities
(or either of them) herein; (iii) any breach by Constellation of its representations, warranties and/or obligations under this Agreement; or (iv) the
subject matter, content or copy contained in any advertising material, promotional material, signage or intellectual property furnished by
Constellation in accordance with this Agreement, including any and all claims for infringement of trademark rights, copyrights, testimonials, rights
of publicity, or the rights to use names, likenesses, slogans, photographs or patents. Indemnity for Products & Services provided by Constellation
hereunder shall be governed by the terms of the applicable Second Level Agreement(s).
(b) By the HOF Entities . Each HOF Entity agrees, on a several but not joint basis, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Constellation, and its shareholders, partners, officers, directors, employees, successors, assigns, representatives, servants and agents (collectively,
the “ Constellation Indemnified Persons ”) from and against, and the HOF Entities waive any claim for contribution or indemnity against any
Constellation Indemnified Person with respect to, any and all Indemnified Losses resulting from or arising out of (i) the use or display by
Constellation of HOF Entity Marks as permitted by this Agreement or (ii) any breach by such HOF Entity of its representations, warranties and/or
obligations under this Agreement.
(c) Notice of Claim. In the event that an HOF Entity seeks indemnification on behalf of an HOF Entity Indemnified Person, or
Constellation seeks indemnification on behalf of a Constellation Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the “ Indemnified Party”)
shall give reasonably prompt notice to the indemnifying Party (the “ Indemnifying Party”) specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim
and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder shall
not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, any Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably
and materially prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than ten (10)
days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.
11
Source: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020(d) Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons . If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim
asserted by any claimant (other than a Constellation Indemnified Person or HOF Entity Indemnified Person) (a “ Third Person ”), the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected
by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a “ Third Person Claim”), provided that the Indemnifying
Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the persons and entities to be indemnified
hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge (and does in fact so discharge) any cost or expense arising out of such
investigation, contest or settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person
Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such
representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to
indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying
Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an irrevocable election
not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third
Person Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it may reasonably deem
appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the
Indemnified Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such action,
with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended
such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by clear and
convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such
Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

6.2 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred by either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that each HOF Entity may, upon written notice to Constellation but without
a requirement to obtain Constellation’s consent, transfer, assign, convey, pledge or encumber, in whole or in part, any and all of its rights under this
Agreement as security in connection with a loan transaction. Assignment of Second Level Agreements will be governed by the terms of the
respective Second Level Agreement.
6.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits attached hereto, which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference,
constitutes the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof between the Parties and shall become a binding and enforceable
agreement among the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns commencing as of the date hereof. No prior verbal or written

modification is expressed in writing and executed by each of the Parties.
6.5 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, without
reference to principles of conflicts of law. Any suit or action filed or otherwise commenced in connection with this Agreement must be filed and
litigated in an appropriate court located in the City of Canton, Ohio (provided, however, that if the suit or action involves a claim for which federal
courts have exclusive jurisdiction, then such suit or action must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of the State of Ohio in
Akron, Ohio), or such other venue as deemed appropriate by the HOF Entities. In the event of a dispute between an HOF Entity and Constellation
regarding their rights and duties hereunder, the non-prevailing Party in any ensuing litigation shall pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses
of the prevailing Party (including costs of discovery and expert witness fees).
6.6 Subordination. This Agreement shall in all respects be subordinate to any and all agreements executed prior to the date of this
Agreement between the HOF Entities and Johnson Controls, Inc. or any of its affiliates. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of any such agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed superseded by such conflicting provision of such other
agreement.
6.7 Force Majeure.
(a) Fire or Other Damage to Village. If the Village is damaged by fire, earthquake, act of God, the elements or other casualty or is
condemned by an authority exercising the powers of eminent domain or the Village is transferred in lieu of the exercise of such power so as to
render the Village unusable for its intended purpose at any time during the Term, then the HOF Entities shall have the option, but not the obligation,
to repair the damage or loss. The HOF Entities shall notify Constellation as to whether the HOF Entities shall effect such repair and restoration
within thirty (30) days after the casualty. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation that the HOF Entities are electing to effect such repairs and
restoration, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that the Term shall be extended by such number of days as
equals the length of the period from the date of the event until such repairs and restoration are complete. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation
that the HOF Entities are electing not to effect such repairs and restoration, then this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder shall terminate as
of the date of such fire or other casualty.
(b) Other. Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither Party shall be liable or responsible for any failure to perform its obligations
hereunder, which failure is caused or brought about in any manner beyond the control of such Party, including, but not limited to, the breakdown or
failure of apparatus, equipment, or machinery employed in its supply of said services, any temporary stoppage for the repair, improvement or
enlargement thereof, or any other act or condition beyond its reasonable control, other than such Party’s inability to perform payment obligations.
14
Source: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020(c) Tolling. In the event that, after the construction and development of the Village has been substantially completed, the Village
is not usable for a period of at least thirty (30) days as a result of the events described under this Section 6.7 and unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Term shall be extended for that period of time (after substantial completion) which the Village was
not usable and the start and end dates of each period shall be adjusted to reflect the number of days (after substantial completion) in which the
Village was not usable for all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the expiration date of the Term.
6.8 Not a Lease or License of the Village. This Agreement will not constitute a lease or license of any part of the Village. It will represent
solely a contractual obligation of the HOF Entities to provide to Constellation certain other benefits hereunder.
6.9 Insurance. Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance
coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person’s right
of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence; and (b) a
general liability insurance policy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] in aggregate . The liability
limits may be met with any combination of primary and excess or umbrella insurance policy limits. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with
certificates of insurance, naming each HOF Entity as an additional insured, evidencing the existence of such insurance policies within ten (10) days
after execution of this Agreement.
6.10 Confidentiality. Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between
Constellation and HOFV dated as of April 28, 2018 (which shall survive in accordance with its terms), the Parties hereto agree to maintain in
confidence the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except with respect to their owners, lenders and advisors, each of whom is to be made
aware of and instructed to comply with this confidentiality provision) unless the proposed disclosure of specific terms or conditions hereof is
authorized in advance by the other Party or is otherwise required by law. In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally
compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other
Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or
another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both.
6.11 Press Releases . The HOF Entities and Constellation shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or scheduling any
press conference or conference call with media members or other third parties with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall mutually agree on the content of any such press release prior to its publication.
6.12 No Defamation or Disparagement . No Party will make, issue or release any statement which results in any defamation or
disparagement of the Village, the City of Canton, the other Party, or any team, person, performer or organization involved in events at the Village.
15
Source: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/20206.13 Independent Contractor. The Parties shall be and act as independent contractors, and under no circumstances shall this Agreement
be construed as one of agency, partnership, joint venture or employment among the Parties.
6.14 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the
provisions set forth herein.
6.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, and on separate counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
6.16 Waiver. No action, other than a notice by a Party to another Party specifically stating that such notice has the effect of waiver, shall
constitute a waiver of any particular breach or default of such other Party. No such waiver notice from a Party shall waive any other Party’s failure
to fully comply with any other term, condition, or provision of this Agreement, irrespective of any knowledge any HOF Entity or Constellation
officer, manager, employee, or agent may have of any breach or default of, or noncompliance with, such other term, condition, or provision. No
waiver of full performance by a Party shall be construed, or operate, as a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and
conditions of this Agreement. The payment or acceptance of fees or charges for any period after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any right
or acceptance of defective performance.
6.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be contrary to law and unenforceable by any court of law, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.
6.18 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the HOF Entity Indemnified Persons and Constellation Indemnified Persons, (i) this Agreement
is intended only for the benefit of the Parties hereto, the affiliates of the HOF Entities and any successors, permitted assigns or substitutes as
expressly provided for in this Agreement, (ii) no other person or entity is intended to be benefited in any way by this Agreement and (iii) this
Agreement shall not be enforceable by any other person or entity.
6.19 Cost and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection
with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
6.20 HOF Entity Rights and Obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that rights vested in the HOF Entities collectively under this
Agreement shall be deemed vested in each HOF Entity and its affiliates and that obligations of the HOF Entities collectively under this Agreement
may be satisfied by either HOF Entity or any of their affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, while certain rights set forth in this
Agreement may be contemplated to be provided by HOFV and other rights set forth in this Agreement may be contemplated to be provided by
PFHOF (or by both HOF Entities), each of such rights may be provided by HOFV, PFHOF and/or any of their respective affiliates.

The Adviser hereby ratifies and confirms as good and effectual, at law or in equity, all that FASC, and its officers and
employees, may do by virtue hereof. However, despite the above provisions, nothing herein shall be construed as imposing a duty on
FASC to act or assume responsibility for any matters referred to above or other matters even though FASC may have power or
authority hereunder to do so. Nothing in this Limited Power of Attorney shall be construed (i) to be an amendment or modifications of,
or supplement to, the Investment Advisory Contract, (ii) to amend, modify, limit or denigrate any duties, obligations or liabilities of the
Adviser under the terms of the Investment Advisory Contract or (iii) exonerate, relieve or release the Adviser from any losses,
obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Adviser (x) under the terms of the Investment Advisory Contract or (y)
at law, or in equity, for the performance of its duties as the investment adviser or subadviser of any of the Funds.
The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the
foregoing an "Indemnified Party" and collectively the "Indemnified Parties") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties,
actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument
or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser,
including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party
against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of
Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted
to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The
obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions
taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.
Any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact hereunder for
the Adviser on behalf of any Fund is hereby expressly put on notice that FASC is acting solely in the capacity as an agent of the
Adviser as agent for the Fund and that any such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity must look solely to the Fund in
question for enforcement of any claim against the Fund, as FASC assumes no personal liability whatsoever for obligations of the Fund
entered into by FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for the Adviser.
Each person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity which deals with a Fund through FASC in its capacity as agent and
attorney-in-fact of the Adviser, is hereby expressly put on notice (i) that all persons or entities dealing with the Fund must look solely
to the assets of the Fund on whose behalf FASC is acting pursuant to its powers hereunder for enforcement of any claim against the
Fund, as the trustees, officers and/or agents of such Fund, the shareholders of the various classes of shares of the Fund, and the other
Funds of the trust or corporation of which a Fund may be a series, assume no personal liability whatsoever for obligations entered into
on behalf of such Fund, and (ii) that the rights, liabilities and obligations of any one Fund are separate and distinct from those of any
other Fund.
The execution of this Limited Power of Attorney by the Adviser acting on behalf of the several Funds shall not be deemed to
evidence the existence of any express or implied joint undertaking or appointment by and among any or all of the Funds. Liability for
or recourse under or upon any undertaking of FASC pursuant to the power or authority granted to FASC under this Limited Power of
Attorney under any rule of law, statute or constitution or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or by legal or equitable
proceedings or otherwise shall be limited only to the assets of the Fund on whose behalf FASC was acting pursuant to the authority
granted hereunder.
The Adviser hereby agrees that no person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC shall be bound to
inquire into FASC's power and authority hereunder and any such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity shall be fully
protected in relying on such power or authority unless such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity has received priorwritten notice from the Adviser that this Limited Power of Attorney has been revoked. This Limited Power of Attorney shall be
revoked and terminated automatically upon the cancellation or termination of the Services Agreement or as to any Fund upon the
cancellation or termination of the Adviser’s Investment Advisory Contract for such Fund. Except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, the powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or terminated by the Adviser at any time provided that
no such revocation or termination shall be effective until FASC has received actual notice of such revocation or termination in writing
from the Adviser.
This Limited Power of Attorney constitutes the entire agreement between the Adviser and FASC and may be changed only
by a writing signed by both of them, except that the Adviser may at any time change the list of Funds to which this Limited Power of
Attorney relates by executing and delivering to FASC a later dated version of Schedule 1. This Limited Power of Attorney shall bind
and benefit the respective successors and assigns of the Adviser and FASC; provided, however, that FASC shall have no power or
authority hereunder to appoint a successor or substitute attorney in fact for the Adviser or any Fund.
This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania without reference to principles of conflicts of laws. If any provision hereof, or any power or authority conferred upon
FASC herein, would be invalid or unexercisable under applicable law, then such provision, power or authority shall be deemed
modified to the extent necessary to render it valid or exercisable while most nearly preserving its original intent, and no provision
hereof, or power or authority conferred upon FASC herein, shall be affected by the invalidity or the non-exercisability of another
provision hereof, or of another power or authority conferred herein.
This Limited Power of Attorney may be executed in as many identical counterparts as may be convenient and by the
different parties hereto on separate counterparts. This Limited Power of Attorney shall become binding on the Adviser when the
Adviser shall have executed at least one counterpart and FASC shall have accepted its appointment by executing this Limited Power
of Attorney. Immediately after the execution of a counterpart original of this Limited Power of Attorney and solely for the
convenience of the parties hereto, the Adviser and FASC will execute sufficient counterparts so that FASC shall have a counterpart
executed by it and the Adviser, and the Adviser shall have a counterpart executed by the Adviser and FASC. Each counterpart shall
be deemed an original and all such taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument, and it shall not be necessary in
making proof of this Limited Power of Attorney to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Adviser has caused this Limited Power of Attorney to be executed by its duly authorized
officer as of the date first written above.

ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Services are provided and any such subcontractor performs any such obligations in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, and (d) the obligations with respect to the nature, quality and standards of care set forth in Section 1.2 are satisfied

practices, as of the Effective Date, including without limitation, with respect to type, quality and timeliness of such maintenance.

and worker’s compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable taxes relating to such employment.

dispute.

3.3 Breach. Any Party (the “ Non-Breaching Party”) may terminate this Agreement with respect to any Service, in whole but not in part, at
any time upon prior written notice to the other Party (the “ Breaching Party”), if the Breaching Party has failed (other than pursuant to Section 3.6)
to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement relating to such Service, and such failure shall have continued without cure for a
period of 30 days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of such failure from the Non-Breaching Party seeking to terminate such
service. For the avoidance of doubt, non-payment by Recipient for a Service provided by Provider in accordance with this Agreement and not the

the subject of any proceedings (not dismissed within sixty (60) days) related to its liquidation, insolvency or the appointment of a receiver, (c) make

shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of
this Agreement.

(g) Certify in writing to Recipient that it has complied with the requirements of this Section 3.6

this Agreement by reason of fire, flood, storm, strike, lockout or other labor trouble or shortage, delays by unaffiliated suppliers or carriers,
shortages of fuel, power, raw materials or components, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, seizure or requirement of any
governmental authority, riot, civil commotion, war, rebellion, acts of terrorism, nuclear accident or other causes beyond the reasonable control of

notice to Recipient, the Services affected by the Force Majeure (the “ Affected Services ”) and/or other requirements of this Agreement will be
suspended during the period of such Force Majeure and Provider will have no liability to Recipient or any other party in connection with such
Affected Services. If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of three months after the date on which the Force
Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services. The notice to terminate must specify the
termination date, which must be not less than ten (10) days after the date on which the notice to terminate is given. Once a notice to terminate has
been validly given, the Affected Services will terminate on the termination date set out in the notice. Neither Party shall have any liability to the
other in respect of termination of the Affected Services due to Force Majeure, but rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to termination shall
subsist.

4.1 Confidentiality. During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the Parties hereto shall, and shall instruct their respective
representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose the other Party’s financial, technical, sales, marketing, development, personnel, and

provided , however, that any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to
be disclosed by law, in which case the Receiving Party shall promptly notify, to the extent possible, the disclosing party (the “ Disclosing Party ”),
and take reasonable steps to assist in contesting such disclosure requirement or in protecting the Disclosing Party’s rights prior to disclosure, and
in which case the Receiving Party shall only disclose such Confidential Information that it is advised by its counsel in writing that it is legally
bound to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “ Confidential Information ” shall not include any information that the Receiving Party can
demonstrate: (a) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known through no act of the Receiving Party or its
representatives in breach of this Section 4.1, (b) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality, or (c) was developed by
it independently without any reliance on the Confidential Information.
4.2 Return of Confidential Information . Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or termination of this
Agreement with respect to any Service, the Receiving Party agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party’s option, all Confidential
Information received in connection with this Agreement. If such Confidential Information is destroyed, an authorized officer of the Receiving Party
shall certify to such destruction in writing.

enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or
awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, “ Losses ”), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising
out of or occurring in connection with Provider’s negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any
settlement without Recipient’s or Indemnified Party’s prior written consent.
6. Miscellaneous .
6.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the documents referred to herein and therein constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof.
66.2 Succession and Assignment . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Provider may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of Recipient.
6.3 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile and electronic mail (including portable document
format (PDF) or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com).

changes occurring to the content of your role from time to time. You may also be required to carry out such additional or
alternative tasks as may from time to time be reasonably required of you consistent with your executive level and job
title, provided that these do not fundamentally change or undermine your position.

endeavours to promote the interests and reputation of the Company and (where applicable) any Group Company.

4.1 Your salary will be USD370,000 per annum paid monthly in arrears on or about the last working day of each month (less
statutory and voluntary deductions) (“ Salary”). Salary will be converted to GBP and paid in GBP based on the USD/GBP
Bank of England daily spot exchange rate applicable on the date of this Agreement, with the exchange rate being revised
according to the prevailing Bank of England daily spot exchange rate applicable on 1 January of each year. Your Salary

4.2 You agree that the Company may deduct from the Salary or any other sum due to you (including any pay in lieu of notice) any
amounts due to the Company including, without limitation, any overpayment of salary, loan or advance.
4.3 For the purposes of this Agreement your earned salary shall mean the proportion of your Salary earned by and due to you in
each calendar year of employment with the Company (“ Earned Salary”).
4.4 Annual Performance Bonuses:
You will be eligible to participate in the Company's discretionary annual performance related bonus scheme to a maximum
value of 35% of your Earned Salary in relation to your performance against agreed annual corporate and personal
performance objectives as set out below (the “ Annual Performance Bonus”). That is, if the compensation committee
(the “ Compensation Committee”) of the board of directors (the “ Board”) of the Company’s parent company, Bicycle
Therapeutics plc (“ BTL”) determines that you have completed all such corporate and personal objectives to its
satisfaction in a given year, your bonus would be 35% of your Earned Salary in that year, excluding any other bonuses in
this offer. Such bonus may be payable in cash or, in whole or in part, in share options in BTL, as agreed by you and the
Compensation Committee following notification by you of your preference at least 90 days prior to the normal payment
date (and in the case of share options with the appropriate HMRC valuation process (if required by the Compensation
Committee) and Board approval so as to be compliant with BTL’s share option plan rules), with due consideration for the
operational requirements of the Company at that time in your role as CBO.
Any Annual Performance Bonus paid will not be pensionable and are subject to statutory applicable tax and National
Insurance deductions. Performance will be assessed by the Compensation Committee at the end of each calendar year,
against annual corporate and personal performance objectives agreed between you and the Board at the start of each
calendar year, with any such bonus being payable in the first quarter of the following year. Qualification for your Annual
Performance Bonus will require that you are employed by the Company (and have not served notice of termination of
your employment to the Company) on 31 December of the year to which your bonus entitlement applies.
24.5 Equity Incentives
BTL has established the Bicycle Therapeutics 2019 Share Option Plan (the “ Option Plan”).
On or as soon as practicable following the Effective Date, it is intended that you will be granted an option under the
Option Plan to acquire 107,417 ordinary shares in the capital of BTL (“ Shares”) (representing approximately 0.6% of the
Company’s issued share capital as at the Effective Date).
In addition, and conditional on completion of a transaction on terms set out below, you will be granted a second option
under the Option Plan, such option being one of:
(a) an option to acquire 44,757 Shares (representing approximately 0.25% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the
Effective Date) granted as soon as practicable following the completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms
which include an upfront payment of at least USD30,000,000 and per product downstream milestone payments of at least

the Effective Date) granted as soon as practicable following the completion of a transaction approved by the Board on
terms which include an upfront payment of USD24,000,000 and per product downstream milestone payments of
USD240,000,000; or
(c) an option to acquire such number of Shares (falling between 0.125% and 0.25% of the Company’s issued share capital
as at the Effective Date as the Board shall determine in its absolute discretion) granted as soon as practicable following
completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms which include an upfront payment greater than
USD24,000,000 but less than USD 30,000,000, and per product downstream milestone payments greater than
USD240,000,000 but less than USD 300,000,000.

Committee; (ii) the rules of the Option Plan (as amended from time to time); and (iii) the terms of the option grant
documentation which will be provided to you following such grant.
5 BENEFITS
5.1 The Company currently operates a personal pension plan provided by Scottish Widows Group. The Company will pay a sum
equivalent to 12 % of your basic annual earned salary into a personal pension plan selected by the Company. You may
make additional contributions if you wish, but this is not mandatory. In the event that you elect, of your own volition, to
opt-out of the Company’s pension scheme then the Company will pay you in equal monthly instalments in arrears (less
statutory deductions) a sum equivalent to the contribution that it would have made into your pension scheme (the
“Cash Equivalent Payment”) less the Employer’s National Insurance Contribution cost incurred by the Company as a
result of making the Cash Equivalent Payment.
5.2 The Company currently operates a private healthcare scheme and subject to acceptance by the insurer on reasonable terms,
you will be entitled to join.
35.3 The Company operates a death in service scheme which you automatically join upon commencement of employment.
5.4 Further details regarding benefits will be provided upon commencement of your employment. The Company reserves the right
to replace or supplement any or all of the scheme(s) referred to in this paragraph 5, or to amend them at any time without
compensation, provided that equivalent scheme(s) providing a similar level of benefit are put in place.
6 EXPENSES
The Company shall reimburse all reasonable out of pocket expenses properly incurred by you in the performance of the
duties under this Agreement including travelling, subsistence and entertainment expenses provided you follow the
Company’s guidelines/allowances in force at the relevant time and provided that you shall, where reasonably practicable,
provide the Company with vouchers, invoices or such other evidence of such expenses as the Company may reasonably
require.
7 HOURS OF WORK
7.1 Your normal working hours are Monday to Friday from 9.00 am to 5.30 pm on each working day with one hour for lunch. You
will be required to work such other hours as shall be reasonably necessary for you to perform your duties for which no
further remuneration is payable.
7.2 By entering into this Agreement you confirm, that in your capacity as Chief Business Officer you may choose or determine the
duration of your working time and the working time limits set out in part II of the Working Time Regulations 1998 do not
apply to you.
8 HOLIDAYS
8.1 In addition to the usual public holidays you will be entitled to 25 working days paid holiday in each calendar year. The holiday
will accrue on a pro rata basis throughout each calendar year.
8.2 Holidays may only be taken at such time or times as are approved beforehand by the CEO, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. You must give reasonable notice of proposed holiday dates by e-mailing the CEO or
delegated director in advance, for approval.
8.3 The holiday year runs from January to December. With the agreement of the CEO, you may carry forward up to 5 days of
untaken holiday into the next holiday year. Any carried over holiday must be taken by the end of March of the following
calendar year or will be forfeited and no payment will be made in respect of any days so forfeited. You will not generally
be permitted to take more than 10 days holiday at any one time.
8.4 Upon termination of your employment you will receive pay in lieu of accrued but untaken holiday. The Company may deduct
an appropriate sum in respect of days taken in excess of your pro rata entitlement from your final remuneration on the
basis that one day’s holiday will be calculated as 1/260ths of your basic annual salary.
8.5 In the event that notice of termination of this Agreement is served by either party, the Company may require you to take any
outstanding holiday during this notice period.
49 SICKNESS AND OTHER ABSENCE
9.1 If you are unable to attend at work by reason of sickness or injury or any unauthorised reason you must inform the Company
as soon as possible on the first day of absence (and in any event not later than 11.00 am on the first day of absence) and,
in the case of absence of uncertain duration, you must keep the Company regularly informed of your continued absence
and your likely date of return. You are expected to observe this rule very strictly since failure to do so will entitle the
Company to stop payment in respect of each day you fail to notify the Company.
9.2 If your absence, due to sickness or injury, is for less than seven (7) days, on your return to work you are required to
immediately complete a self-certification form available from the Company. If your absence continues for more than seven
(7) consecutive days (whether or not working days) you must provide the Company with a doctor's certificate from the
seventh consecutive day of sickness or injury. This doctor’s certificate must be provided to the Company promptly
following the seventh consecutive day of absence. If illness continues after the expiry of the first certificate, further
certificates must be provided promptly to cover the whole period of absence.
9.3 Subject to your compliance with the Company’s sickness absence procedures (as amended from time to time), the Company
may in its sole and absolute discretion pay full salary and contractual benefits during any period of absence due to
sickness or injury for up to an aggregate of 3 months in any fifty-two (52) week period (whether such absence is
continuous or intermittent in any calendar year). Such payment shall be inclusive of any statutory sick pay due in
accordance with applicable legislation in force at the time of absence. The Company may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, extend the period of allowance in an individual case if the circumstances so justify. Thereafter, the Company
shall pay statutory sick pay or equivalent benefit to which you may be entitled subject to your compliance with the
appropriate rules.
9.4 Whether absent from work or not, you may be, but only on reasonable grounds, required to undergo a medical examination by
a Company doctor and your consent will be sought for a report to be sent to the Company.
9.5 The payment of sick pay in accordance with this paragraph 9 is without prejudice to the Company’s right to terminate this
Agreement prior to the expiry of your right to payments.
9.6 In the event you are incapable of performing your duties by reason of injuries sustained wholly or partly as a result of a third
party's actions all payments made to you by the Company as salary or sick pay shall to the extent that compensation is
recoverable from that third party constitute loans to you and shall be due and owing when and to the extent that you
recover compensation for loss of earnings from the third party.
10 GARDEN LEAVE

part of your notice period, to comply with any or all of the following instructions:
(a) not to carry out any further work for the Company or for any Group Company;
(b) to remain away from the Company’s business premises and those of any Group

available for work.
10.2 During any such period as described in paragraph 10.1 (“ Garden Leave”) the Company may appoint another person to carry
out some or all of your duties. You will continue to owe all other duties and obligations (whether express or implied
including fidelity and good faith) during Garden Leave and you shall continue to receive full pay and benefits (except
that you will not accrue any further entitlement to any cash or equity incentive awards or bonus payments in respect of
the Garden Leave period).
10.3 By placing you on Garden Leave, the Company will not be in breach of this Agreement or any implied duty of any kind
whatsoever nor will you have any claim against the Company in respect of any such action.
10.4 During any period of Garden Leave you will remain readily contactable and available for work save when on paid holiday
taken in accordance with paragraph 8. In the event that you are not available for work having been requested by the
Company to do so, you will, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, forfeit any right to salary and
contractual benefits.
10.5 During any period of Garden Leave the Company may require you to deliver up any Confidential Information or property of

made pursuant to this paragraph 11.2 will not include any element in relation to any payment in respect of (i) any Annual
Performance Bonus or (ii) any holiday entitlement that would have otherwise accrued during the period for which the
payment in lieu is made. For the further avoidance of doubt, if the Company elects to make a Payment in Lieu after notice
of termination has been given by you, this will not constitute a termination by the Company without Cause for the
purposes of paragraphs 11.7 and 11.8 below.
11.3 The Company may summarily terminate your employment hereunder (without notice) for Cause. For purposes of this
Agreement, “Cause” shall mean where you:

business or affairs of the Company;

entitlement to benefit from sick pay under paragraph 9.3 above.
Any delay or forbearance by the Company in exercising any right of termination in accordance with this paragraph 11.3
will not constitute a waiver of such right.
11.4 You may summarily terminate your employment hereunder at any time (without notice) for Good Reason after complying with
the Good Reason Process. For purposes of this Agreement, “ Good Reason” shall mean that you have complied with the
“Good Reason Process” (hereinafter defined) following the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a material
diminution in your responsibilities, authority or duties; (ii) a material diminution in your Salary; (iii) a material change in
the geographic location at which you provides services to the Company; or (iv) the material breach of this Agreement by
the Company. “Good Reason Process” shall mean that (i) you reasonably determine in good faith that a “Good Reason”
condition has occurred; (ii) you notify the Company in writing of the first occurrence of the Good
7Reason condition within 60 days of the first occurrence of such condition; (iii) you cooperate in good faith with the
Company’s efforts, for a period not less than 30 days following such notice (the “ Cure Period ”), to remedy the
condition; (iv) notwithstanding such efforts, the Good Reason condition continues to exist; and (v) you terminate your
employment (without notice) within 60 days after the end of the Cure Period. If the Company cures the Good Reason
condition during the Cure Period, Good Reason shall be deemed not to have occurred.
11.5 Your employment hereunder shall also terminate immediately upon your death.
11.6 If your employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, the Company shall pay or provide to you (or to your
authorised representative or estate) (i) any Salary earned through the Termination Date (as defined below); (ii) unpaid
expense reimbursements (subject to, and in accordance with, paragraph 6 of this Agreement); and (iii) any vested
benefits you may have under any employee benefit plan of the Company through the Termination Date, which vested
benefits shall be paid and/or provided in accordance with the terms of such employee benefit plans (collectively, the
“Accrued Benefits”).
Severance Pay and Benefits Upon Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason outside the
Change in Control Period.
11.7 If your employment is terminated on account of your death or by the Company without Cause (being for any reason not
covered by paragraph 11.3), or you terminate your employment for Good Reason (as provided in paragraph 11.4), in either
case outside of the Change in Control Period, then the Company shall pay you the Accrued Benefits. In addition, subject

regarding severance pay and benefits upon a termination by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason if
such termination of employment occurs within 12 months after the occurrence of the first event constituting a Change in
Control (such period, the “ Change in Control Period”). These provisions shall terminate and be of no further

MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT
Between
RadialSpark, LLC
and
Clear Capital
Page 1 of 10THIS MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT (“Agreement”), dated as of 09/24/2018 (the “Effective Date”), is between Clear Capital (the "Company") and
RadialSpark, LLC (the "Contractor").
WHEREAS, Company desires from time to time to retain Contractor to perform certain management consulting services for Company; and
WHEREAS, Contractor desires to perform such management consulting services for Company;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:
1. PURPOSE OF ENGAGEMENT.
(a) Company agrees to retain Contractor to perform the consulting services for Company, on a task by task basis (the "Services"), and Contractor agrees
to furnish the Services on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement, Company and
Contractor will develop and agree upon statements of work defining the Services and work product to be provided by Contractor, Contractor’s
compensation, additional terms and conditions, if any, applicable to a particular engagement and such other details as the parties deem appropriate (each
a “Statement of Work”). A Statement of Work may provide specifications for deliverables to be provided thereunder (the "Specifications"). Statements of
Work that are from time to time agreed upon shall reference this Agreement, and shall be executed by the parties and attached hereto and shall form a part
hereof. In all instances of a conflict, between the provisions of this Agreement and the specific provisions set forth in a Statement of Work, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control.
(b) Contractor shall provide sufficient qualified personnel to perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry
standards. A Statement of Work may designate certain individuals as "Key Personnel" for an engagement, and the parties subsequently may agree in
writing that additional individuals are Key Personnel for such engagement. If there are Key Personnel for an engagement, Contractor shall provide the
Services through those personnel and such additional personnel of Contractor as Contractor may from time to time determine to be required for the
performance of the Services. Company shall have the right to interview and approve such additional personnel at Company’s request. If one or more Key
Personnel terminate their employment with Contractor or otherwise become
Page 2 of 10unavailable to work on an engagement for reasons beyond Contractor's reasonable control, Contractor may provide the Services through other personnel
with comparable training and experience. If Company becomes dissatisfied with any of Contractor's personnel providing the Services, Company may
notify Contractor of the details of its dissatisfaction, and the parties shall cooperate to remedy the problem as soon as possible. If Company reasonably
requests, Contractor shall reassign the individual who is the subject of Company's dissatisfaction and replace that person with other personnel in
accordance with this Agreement.
(c) Unless otherwise provided in a Statement of Work, Contractor shall provide the Services at Contractor’s facility. Contractor shall provide computing
equipment consistent with the Services to be provided under the Statement of Work. When services are provided at a Company facility, Company shall
provide workspace and other facilities such as computer support consistent with the requirements of the Services to be provided under the Statement of
Work. Contractor shall cause its personnel at Company's facility to comply with Company's (i) safety and security rules and other rules applicable to
those working in the facility, and (ii) Company's policies concerning access to and security of any Company computer system to which Contractor may
have access; provided, that Company has provided Contractor with copies of such rules and policies or has advised Contractor of the existence of such
rules and policies.
(d) Company may request changes that affect the scope or duration of the Services relating to any Statement of Work, including changes in the
Specifications and changes in the deliverables to be delivered. Company acknowledges that any change in Specifications may result in changes to
estimated fees and estimated timeline for creation of deliverables. Company also may request a change in the Schedule without changing the scope of the
Services relating to the applicable Statement of Work. In either case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment in the
applicable fees, Schedule and Specifications. Contractor shall continue work pursuant to the existing Statement of Work, and shall not be bound by any
change requested by Company, until such change has been accepted in writing by Contractor.
(e) The obligations of Company in connection with a particular engagement shall be set forth in the applicable Statement of Work. Company agrees to
perform such obligations in accordance with, and subject to, such Statement of Work. Company acknowledges that when a Statement of Work provides
that Company's personnel are to work with Contractor's personnel in connection with an engagement, Company's failure to assign Company personnel
having skills commensurate with their role with respect to such engagement could adversely affect Contractor's ability to provide the Services.
Page 3 of 10(f) To the extent Contractor provides any third party materials and products Contractor acknowledges that it shall be solely responsible for ensuring the
functionality and specifications of such third party materials and products used in performing Services under this Agreement.
2. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall begin on the date hereof and shall continue until terminated by either party pursuant to Paragraph 6 hereof.
3. CONTRACTOR'S COMPENSATION.
(a) During the term of this Agreement, Company agrees to compensate Contractor as set forth in each Statement of Work. Contractor will be compensated
on a time and materials. In addition, Company shall reimburse Contractor its actual out-of-pocket expenses as reasonably incurred by Contractor in
connection with its performance of the Services as negotiated in each Statement of Work.
(b) Contractor shall bill Company as set forth in the relevant Statement of Work. Each invoice submitted by Contractor will provide supporting detail for
the Services invoiced, including, to the extent applicable to a particular engagement, the dates of Services and hours worked at the applicable rate by
Statement of Work. Invoices shall also include receipts or other supporting detail concerning related expenses within the billing cycle. Contractor
reserves the right to change rates with 30 days notice to Company.
(c) All fees, charges and other amounts payable to Contractor hereunder do not include any sales, use, excise, value added or other applicable taxes,
tariffs or duties, payment of which shall be the sole responsibility of Company (excluding any applicable taxes based on Contractor's net income or taxes
arising from the independent contractor relationship between Contractor and its personnel). In the event that such taxes, tariffs or duties are assessed
against Contractor, Company shall reimburse Contractor for any such amounts paid by Contractor or provide Contractor with valid tax exemption
certificates with respect thereto.
4. OWNERSHIP OF MATERIALS RELATED TO SERVICES; ACCEPTANCE.
(a) The parties agree that all drawings, documents, designs, models, inventions, computer programs, computer systems, data, computer documentation
and other tangible materials authored or prepared by Contractor for Company as the work product required by a Statement of Work (collectively, the
"Works"), are the property of Company to the extent that such Works were created by Contractor for Company over a time period for which Company has
been invoiced and said invoice has been paid. Contractor agrees to render, at Company’s sole cost
Page 4 of 10and expense, all reasonably required assistance to Company to protect the rights herein above described, including executing other documents as
requested by Company.
(b) Company acknowledges that Contractor provides consulting and development services to other clients, and agrees that nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed or construed to prevent Contractor from delivering on such business. In particular, Company agrees that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein: (i) as part of Contractor’s provision of the Services hereunder, Contractor may utilize its own proprietary works of
authorship, that have not been created specifically for Company, including without limitation software, methodologies, tools, specifications, drawings,
sketches, models, samples, records and documentation, as well as copyrights, trademarks, servicemarks, ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques,
knowledge or data, which have been originated, developed or purchased by Contractor or by third parties under contract to Contractor, and, (ii)
Contractor’s Information and Contractor’s administrative communications and records relating to the Services shall not be deemed to be Works and are
and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Contractor and Company shall not resell or make use of said property in any other manner other than
in connection with the software Company receives under this Agreement.
(c) To the extent that Contractor incorporates any of Contractor’s Information into the Works, Contractor hereby grants to Company a royalty-free, non-
exclusive perpetual license (including the right to grant a sublicense) to use, copy, modify, create, derivative version, publicly perform and publicly
display such Contractor’s Information in connection with Company’s business operations.
(d) Consultant agrees that after Company pays Contractor in full, or after the termination of this agreement, Company may make any changes or additions
to the software Consultant created for Company under this Agreement, which Company in Company’s discretion may consider necessary, and Company
may engage others to make any such changes or additions, without further payments to Consultant.

within ninety (90) days of the Effective Dave announcing the Agreement.
(c) The relationship of the Parties is that of independent contractors, and nothing herein is intended, nor should be construed, to create a
partnership, agency, joint venture or employment relationship. No act or statement of either Party will operate to bind the other and neither Party
will hold itself out or have any authority as an agent of the other for any purposes whatsoever.
(d) If any legal action, including, without limitation, an action for arbitration or injunctive relief, is brought relating to the Agreement or in breach
hereof, the prevailing party in any final judgment or arbitration award shall be entitled to recover its reasonable expenses, including all court costs,
arbitration fees and reasonable attorney's fees.
(e) All notices provided pursuant to this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed given (i) if by personal delivery, upon receipt thereof; (ii) if
mailed five 5 days after deposit in the US mail, postage prepaid, certified mail return receipt requested; or (iii) if sent via overnight courier, upon
receipt. All notices will be sent to the person who has signed this Agreement (at the address set forth above) or to such other person or address as
either party may specify in writing.
(f) If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, illegal or invalid under any applicable Law or court of competent jurisdiction, then such
unenforceability or invalidity will not render the Agreement unenforceable or invalid. In such event, such provision will be deemed restated in
accordance with applicable Law to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement will remain
in full force and effect. Provisions that should reasonably be considered to survive termination of the Agreement will survive and be enforceable
after such termination or expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality, proprietary rights, indemnification, limitations
of liability, effects of termination, and governing Law. The delay or failure of either Party to exercise any right or power provided in this Agreement
or to require performance by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement will not impair such right or power, or be deemed a waiver thereof.
A waiver by either Party of any covenants to be performed by the other or any breach thereof will not be taken or held to be a waiver of any
succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant contained in this Agreement or under any agreement.
(g) Neither Party will be liable under this Agreement by reason of any damages, failure or delays in the performance of its obligations under such
Agreement (except for the payment of money) on account of any cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party, such as fire, explosion, power
failures, pest damage, lightning or power surges, strikes or labor disputes, water, war, civil disturbances, terrorism, acts of civil or military
authorities, inability to secure raw materials, transportation facilities, fuel or energy shortages, performance or availability of communications
services or networks and network facilities failures of any suppliers or service providers, or other causes beyond the Party's reasonable control.
(h) Neither Party may assign (voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise) this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the other Party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided however, that either Party may assign this
Agreement without approval or consent to any affiliate or purchaser of all or substantially all of said Party's assets related to the subject matter of
this Agreement or to any successor by way of merger, stock sale, consolidation or similar transaction. Any attempted assignment other than in
accordance herewith will be void. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. The Agreement completely and exclusively states the agreement of the Parties regarding its subject matter. This
Agreement supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written,
regarding its subject matter.
(i) This Agreement is intended for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties hereto, is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any third
party, and only the Parties may enforce such Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding on both Parties when signed on behalf of each Party, and
may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and both of which when taken together will constitute
one and the same agreement. Fax or electronically scanned copies of such executed documents may be used in lieu of the originals for any purpose.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the dates
written below.

(c) In connection with any question of law arising in the course of Agent performing its duties hereunder, Agent may consult with legal

in fact or law), demand, cost or expense (collectively, “Loss”) arising out of or in connection with Agent’s duties under this Agreement or this
appointment, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any Loss or enforcing this Agreement, except to the extent
that such Loss shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of Agent’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct.
8. Limitation of Liability.
(a) In the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it or for any error of judgment made by it in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. In noevent will Agent be liable for special, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if Agent has been advised of the possibility of such losses or damages and regardless of the form of action. Any
liability of Agent will be limited in the aggregate to an amount equal to twenty four (24) times the monthly administrative fee to be paid by Client as
set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
(b) If any question or dispute arises with respect to the proper interpretation of this Agreement or Agent’s duties hereunder, Agent shall not
be required to act or be held liable or responsible for its failure or refusal to act until the question or dispute has been (i) judicially settled (and
Agent may, if it deems it advisable, but shall not be obligated to, file a suit in interpleader or for a declaratory judgment for such purpose) by a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that is binding on all parties interested in the matter and is no longer subject to review or appeal, or
(ii) settled by a written document in form and substance satisfactory to Agent and executed by Client. For such purpose, Agent may, but shall not
be obligated to, require the execution of such a document.
9. Force Majeure.  Agent shall not be liable for any failures, delays or losses, arising directly or indirectly out of conditions beyond its reasonable
control, including, but not limited to, acts of government, exchange or market ruling, suspension of trading, work stoppages or labor disputes, civil
disobedience, riots, rebellions, electrical or mechanical failure, computer hardware or software failure, communications facilities failures including
telephone failure, war, terrorism, insurrection, fires, earthquakes, storms, floods, acts of God or similar occurrences.
10. Market Data.  Client acknowledges that Agent may provide real-time or delayed quotations and other market information and messages
(“Market Data”), which Market Data is provided to Agent by certain national securities exchanges and associations who assert a proprietary
interest in Market Data disseminated by them but do not guarantee the timeliness, sequence, accuracy or completeness thereof. Client agrees and
acknowledges that Agent shall not be liable in any way for any loss or damage arising from or occasioned by any inaccuracy, error, delay in,
omission of, or interruption in any Market Data or the transmission thereof.
11. Termination.
(a) Client may terminate this Agreement if (i) Agent defaults on any of its material obligations hereunder and such default remains uncured
thirty (30) days after Agent’s receipt of notice of such default from Client; or (ii) any proceeding in bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or
insolvency is commenced by or against Agent, Agent shall become insolvent or shall cease paying its obligations as they become due or makes
any assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
(b) Agent may suspend providing services hereunder or terminate this Agreement if (i) Client fails to pay amounts due hereunder or defaults
on any of its material obligations hereunder and such failure or default remains uncured thirty (30)days after Client’s receipt of notice of such failure or default from Agent; (ii) any proceeding in bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or
insolvency is commenced by or against Client, Client shall become insolvent, or shall cease paying its obligations as they become due or makes
any assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (iii) Client is acquired by or is merged with or into another entity where Client is not the surviving
company.
(c) Upon termination of this Agreement, all fees earned and expenses incurred by Agent up to and including the date of such termination

section, if this Agreement is terminated by Client for any reason other than pursuant to Section 2 or Section 11(a) above or by Agent pursuant to
Section 11(b) above, then Client shall pay a termination fee, due and payable to Agent on or before the effective date of such termination,
calculated as follows: (i) if the termination occurs prior to the first anniversary of the commencement date of the current term (the “Commencement
Date”), then the termination fee shall equal twelve (12) times the average monthly invoice charged to Client by Agent hereunder, (ii) if the
termination occurs on or after the first anniversary of the Commencement Date but prior to the second anniversary of the Commencement Date,
then the termination fee shall equal nine (9) times the average monthly invoice charged to Client by Agent hereunder, and (iii) if the termination
occurs on or after the second anniversary of the Commencement Date, then the termination fee shall equal six (6) times the average monthly invoice
charged to Client by Agent hereunder. For purposes of this paragraph, fees for non-recurring events shall be excluded when calculating the
average monthly invoice charged to Client by Agent
(d) Prior to termination of this Agreement, Client shall provide Agent with written instructions as to the disposition of records, as well as any
additional documentation reasonably requested by Agent. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the respective rights and
duties of Client and Agent under this Agreement shall cease upon termination of this Agreement.

destroyed or stolen unless Agent shall have received: (a) an affidavit of such loss, destruction or theft; (b) a bond of indemnity in form and
substance satisfactory to Agent; and (c) payment of all applicable fees. Shareholders may obtain such a bond of indemnity from a surety company
of the shareholder’s choice, provided the surety company satisfies Agent’s minimum requirements.

had rightfully in its possession prior to disclosure to it by the disclosing party; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without the

the disclosing party who the receiving party has the reasonable belief has the right to transfer or disclose it or (v) required in any legal or regulatory
proceeding, investigation, audit examination, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process or required by operation of law or
regulation.
(b) In connection with the provision of services under this Agreement, Client may direct Agent to release information, including non-public

to Regulation P of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve) to Client’s agents or other third party service providers, including, without
limitation, broker/dealers, custodians and depositories. In addition, Client consents to the release of information, including NPPI, (i) to any of
Agent’s Representatives in connection with the services provided hereunder and (ii) as required by law, regulation, subpoena or governmental
authority. Agent shall not be liable for the release of information in accordance with the foregoing provisions.
14. Publicity. Neither party will issue a news release, public announcement, advertisement, or other form of publicity concerning the existence of
this Agreement or the Services to be provided hereunder without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party, which may be withheld in

15. Lost Stockholders; In-Depth Stockholder Search.
(a) Agent shall conduct such database searches to locate lost stockholders as are required by Rule 17Ad-17 under the Exchange Act, without
charge to the stockholder. If a new address is so obtained in a database search for a lost stockholder, Agent shall conduct a verification mailing and

(b) Agent may conduct a more in-depth search for the purpose of (i) locating lost stockholders for whom a new address is not obtained in
accordance with clause (a) above, (ii) identifying stockholders who are deceased (or locating their next of kin) and(iii) locating stockholders whose accounts contain two or more consecutive uncashed checks, in each case using the services of a locating service
provider selected by Agent. Such provider may compensate Agent for processing and other services that Agent provides in connection with such
in-depth search.
(c) Upon locating any stockholder (or next of kin) pursuant to clause (b) above, the locating service provider shall clearly identify to such
stockholder (or next of kin) all assets held in such stockholder’s account. Such provider shall inform any such located stockholders (or next of kin)

replace lost certificates, or (ii) to use the services of such provider for a fee, which may not exceed (A) 10% of the asset value of such stockholder’s
property where the registered stockholder is a living person or (B) 20% of the asset value of such stockholder’s property where the registered
stockholder is deceased or is not a natural person; provided that in no case shall such fee exceed the maximum statutory fee permitted by the
applicable state jurisdiction. If Client selects a locating service provider other than one selected by Agent, then Agent shall not be responsible for

meetings, link-up charges from Automatic Data Processing Inc. and tape charges from The Depository Trust Company. While Agent endeavors to

and in some instances may include handling charges to cover internal processing and use of Agent’s billing systems.
(d) With respect to any shareholder mailings processed by Agent, Client shall be charged postage as an out-of-pocket expense at postage
rates that may not reflect all available or utilized postal discounts, such as presort or NCOA discounts. Client shall, at least one business day prior

B-6OTHER SERVICES AND CHARGES
Shareholder Plan Enrollment : If Client has appointed a banking affiliate of Agent to administer a direct stock purchase and/or dividend
reinvestment plan, Agent (on behalf of such affiliate) shall accept requests by Client’s shareholders to enroll Shares in such plan via paper
enrollment form, in the case of certificated securities, and via paper enrollment form, Internet enrollment and telephonic enrollment, in the case of
book-entry (i.e., Direct Registration System) securities. If Client has not appointed a banking affiliate of Agent to administer a direct stock purchase
or dividend reinvestment plan, then Client hereby appoints and directs a banking affiliate of Agent to implement and administer a share selling
program (“Program”) pursuant to which shareholders may enroll book-entry Shares in the Program in order to liquidate them under the following
terms and conditions. The Program transaction fee for each such sale shall be $15.00 plus $0.12 per Share. Under the Program, upon receipt of a sale
request by a registered shareholder, Agent (on behalf of such banking affiliate) will process the request through an affiliated registered
broker/dealer. Proceeds of each sale under the Program will be sent to the shareholder in the form of a check (less the transaction fee). Sale requests
under the Program will typically be combined with other sale requests received from Client shareholders and Shares will be submitted in bulk to an
affiliated registered broker/dealer for sale. Shares will be sold under the Program generally within one business day of Agent’s receipt (on behalf of
such banking affiliate) of the sale request, but in no event more than five business days (except where deferral is necessary under state or federal
regulations). The price per Share received by the selling shareholder under the Program will equal the market price Agent (on behalf of such
banking affiliate) receives for the Shares (or, if more than one bulk trade is executed on the day the Shares are sold, then the price per Share shall
equal the weighted average market price received for all Shares sold that day).
Prior Agent Out-of-Proof Conditions:  If an out-of-proof condition exists on the Effective Date, and such condition is not resolved within 90
calendar days thereafter, Client agrees to provide Agent with funds or shares sufficient to resolve the out-of-proof condition promptly upon the
expiration of such 90 day period.
Lost Certificates: Agent shall charge shareholders an administrative fee for replacement of lost certificates, which shall be charged only once in
instances where a single surety bond obtained covers multiple certificates. Agent may receive compensation from surety companies or surety
agents for administrative services provided to them.
Legal Expenses, System Modifications: Certain expenses may be incurred in resolving legal matters, including receiving and responding to routine
subpoenas that arise in the course of performing services hereunder. This may result in a separate charge to cover Agent’s expenses (including the
cost of external or internal counsel) in resolving such matters; provided that any legal expenses charged to the Client shall be reasonable.
In the event any federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations are enacted that require Agent to (i) make any adjustments and/or modifications to
its current system, or (ii)
B-7provide additional services to Client for which Agent is not being compensated hereunder, then Client shall compensate Agent (a) on a pro rata
basis proportionate to the Client’s registered shareholder base, for the costs associated with making such required adjustments and/or
modifications, or (b) according to Agent’s standard fees established, in good faith, with respect to such additional services.
Initial Compliance Escheatment Services : If, at the time escheat services are commenced for any asset type, Client is not in compliance with
applicable state unclaimed property regulations with respect to that asset type, then Agent shall provide initial compliance services, which shall
include working with one or more state unclaimed property clearinghouses to identify specific reportable records and property, and organizing and
formatting such records and property for remittance to the applicable states, as required. Where applicable, in concert with state clearinghouses,
Agent shall also attempt to obtain releases and indemnification agreements protecting Client from interest and penalties that may be assessable
against Client by the states for prior non-compliance. If a release or indemnification agreement is not so obtained from a state, Client may be
responsible for interest and/or penalties from such state for prior non-compliance. Agent may receive compensation from state clearinghouses for
the processing and support services it provides to them in connection with initial compliance services.
Cash Dividends and Distributions: For any dividend mailing, Client shall, no later than 10 am Eastern Time on the mail date for the dividend,
provide to Agent immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash dividends to be paid. Upon receipt of any such funds,
Agent shall (a) in the case of registered shareholders who are participants in a dividend reinvestment plan of Client as of the record date, reinvest
such funds in accordance with the terms of such plan, and (b) in the case of registered shareholders who are not participants in any such plan as of
the record date, make payment of such funds to such shareholders by mailing a check, payable to the registered shareholder, to the address of
record or, if different, dividend mailing address. If Agent has not timely received sufficient funds to make payments of any dividend or distribution
pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above to all registered shareholders of Client as of the record date, Agent shall notify Client and withhold all
payments until Client has provided sufficient funds to Agent.
Other Services: Fees, out of pocket expenses and disbursements for any services, including, but not limited to, down posting for odd lots, provided
to Client or any of its agents or representatives by or on behalf of Agent hereunder that are not set forth above will be based on Agent’s standard
fees at the time such services are provided or, if no standard fees have been established, an appraisal of the work to be performed.

(b) From and after the date on which a Receivable or Participation Interest, as applicable, is sold to the Owner, the Servicer shall
service and administer each related Serviced Asset for the benefit of the Owner and shall extend, amend or otherwise modify such
Serviced Asset, by complying in all material respects with the following (collectively, the “Servicing Standard”): (A) reasonable
care, using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to comparable receivables that it services for
itself or others, and (B) Applicable Law.
(c) The Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it hereunder,including any Sub-Servicer, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem
necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Servicing Agreement and the Servicing Standard. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless such power is revoked by the Owner on account of the occurrence of a Servicer Default, the
Servicer shall have full power and authority (i) to make withdrawals from the applicable servicer collection account permitted by
the terms of this Servicing Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document and (ii) to execute and deliver, on behalf
of the Owner, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other
comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and, after the delinquency of any Receivable and to the extent permitted
under and in compliance with applicable Servicing Standard and the Loan Agreement, to commence collection proceedings with
respect to such Receivables. The Owner shall furnish the Servicer with any documents reasonably requested by the Servicer,
including powers of attorney, as necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer (or any Sub-Servicer on its behalf) to carry out its
servicing and administrative duties hereunder.
(d) The Servicer shall collect and process all collections on the Serviced Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions set

order to comply with federal, state or foreign securities laws, or exemptions thereunder; and

(b) In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of its other obligations under this Agreement, the Servicer may enter into transactions
with or otherwise deal with any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that the terms of any such transactions or dealings shall be no
less favorable to the Owner than would be available from unaffiliated parties, that Owner shall have no responsibility or liability for
any fees payable to such Affiliates to perform such obligations as contemplated by this Agreement and that the Owner shall not be
deemed pursuant to this Section 2(b) to enter into any contractual obligations with such Affiliates.

of the Owner or any other Person; provided, that the Owner shall not be liable for or required to indemnify a Servicer Indemnified
Party from and against expenses arising or resulting from such Servicer Indemnified Party’s own willful misconduct, bad faith or

termination of this Agreement.
(d) Subject to Sections 4 and 5, the Servicer shall administer, perform or supervise the performance of such other activities in
connection with the Serviced Assets (including the Loan Documents) as are not covered by any of the foregoing provisions and are
reasonably within the capability of the Servicer. In no case may Servicer use any identifiable information, including consumers’
nonpublic personal information and related account performance and status information, for any purpose other than as provided in
this Agreement; provided, however, that Servicer is permitted to use nonidentifiable, aggregated consumer information obtained in
connection with its activities undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be obligated to, and shall not, take any action
that the Owner directs the Servicer not to take or which could reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of the
Owner’s covenants, agreements or obligations under any of the Loan Documents.
(f) The Servicer shall maintain appropriate books of account and records relating to services performed hereunder, which books of
account and records shall be accessible for inspection by the Owner at any time during normal business hours.

obligations hereunder; provided, however, Servicer shall be subject to the Owner’s third-party vendor management program.
Unless expressly authorized by the Owner in this Agreement or otherwise, the Servicer shall have no authority to act for or
represent the Owner in any way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Owner.
Section 5. No Joint Venture. Nothing contained in this Agreement (i) shall constitute the Servicer and the Owner as members of
any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate, unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to
impose any liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to confer on any of them any express, implied or apparent
authority to incur any obligation or liability on behalf of the others.
Section 6. Other Activities of Servicer. Nothing herein shall prevent the Servicer or its respective Affiliates from engaging in other
businesses or, in its sole discretion, from acting in a similar capacity for any other person or entity even though such person or entity
may engage in business activities similar to those of the Owner.

cure as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Owner); or
(ii) the Servicer files or consents to the filing of any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any applicable
insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization statute, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or

to the Owner within seven (7) days after the occurrence of such event.

If a successor Servicer does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Servicer resigns or is removed, the resigning or
removed Servicer or the Owner may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Servicer.
In the event that the Servicer resigns or is terminated hereunder, the Servicer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to and

provided, however, that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related subservicing agreement (if any) must provide for
the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a manner equivalent or greater than the Servicing Standard; provided, further, that the
Servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the Owner for the servicing and administering of the Serviced Assets in accordance
with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such Sub-Servicer and

3. EXECUTIVE’S DUTIES
3.1 The Executive shall serve the Company as Chief Financial Officer and as an Executive Director of WPP plc, and/or in such other

4. PLACE OF WORK
4.1 The Executive’s normal place of work shall be the Company’s head office in the UK from time to time as the Company may
reasonably determine, for the proper performance of his duties. The Executive shall travel to such places (inside and) outside the
UK as may be required in order to properly perform his duties, in particular, to the head office in the USA. In connection therewith,
the Executive is likely from time to time to be required to work outside the UK for periods exceeding one month.
4.2 There are currently no additional terms which apply where the Executive is required to work outside the UK for a period exceeding
one month, but the Company reserves the right to issue such terms, and any such terms will be notified to the Executive.
5. WORKING HOURS
5.1 The parties agree that the Executive’s role and senior status are such that the Executive will determine the whole of his working
time himself and his working time cannot be measured or pre-determined and, accordingly, that the Appointment falls within the
scope of Regulation 20 of the Working Time Regulations 1998, meaning that the restrictions on working time set out in the
Working Time Regulations do not apply to him.
5.2 During the Appointment, unless prevented by ill-health or accident and except during holiday taken in accordance with clause 11,
the Executive shall devote the whole of his time, skill and attention during normal business hours, and at such other times as may
be reasonably necessary (without additional remuneration), to his duties under this Agreement.
6. REMUNERATION
6.1 The Company will pay the Executive a salary of £740,000 and a fixed benefits allowance of £30,000 per annum. The salary (and so
far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on
or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive
of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company.
6.2 The Executive’s salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee every two years. There will be no salary review after
notice to terminate this Agreement has been given by either party. The Company has no obligation to increase the Executive’s
salary following a review.
6.3 The Executive will be eligible to participate in any bonus or discretionary remuneration plan on such terms as the Compensation
Committee may from time to time decide and always subject to the terms of the Executive Remuneration policy as approved by
shareholders of WPP plc and to additional terms and conditions including the malus and clawback provisions of all relevant share
or stock plans and as referred to in Schedule 2.
6.4 Any bonus payment to the Executive shall be purely discretionary and shall not form part of the Executive’s contractual
remuneration under this Agreement. Payment of a bonus to the Executive in
5Table of Contents
one year shall confer no right on the Executive to receive a bonus in any other year. Specifically, but without limitation, the
Executive shall have no right to be considered for, or payment of, a bonus where the Executive is subject to, or may about to be
subject to, an ongoing investigation or disciplinary process into facts or matters which could lead to such bonus being forfeited, or
reduced and in all events if the Appointment has terminated for any reason or if he is under notice of termination whether given by
the Executive or the Company at or prior to the date when a bonus might otherwise have been payable. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Executive is exonerated of any of the allegations made during any such disciplinary process or if any investigation
does not result in any material action against the Executive, he will (once the disciplinary process or investigation is concluded)
have the right to be considered for a bonus as if there had been no such investigation or disciplinary process. If any bonus
becomes payable in such circumstances it will be paid without delay following the conclusion of the disciplinary process or
investigation.
6.5 The Executive hereby irrevocably consents to the Company, at any time during the Appointment or on its termination (however
arising), deducting from salary or any other payments due to the Executive in respect of the Appointment any monies due from
him to the Company or any Group Company.
6.6 The Executive agrees that every benefit arising out of or in connection with his employment whilst he remains a director is subject
to change (including detrimental change without compensation) where any particular benefit paid, or otherwise owing or becoming
payable to him in the future, breaches or may breach the terms of the shareholder approved Executive Compensation Policy at
any time.
7. EXPENSES
The Company will reimburse the Executive (on production of such evidence as it may reasonably require) the amount of all
travelling and other expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him in the discharge of his duties in strict accordance with the
Company’s expenses policy from time to time.
8. PENSION
8.1 The Company operates a Group pension plan (the Plan). The Executive is entitled to participate in the Plan (or such pension
scheme as may be established by the Company to replace the Plan), subject to its trust deeds and rules from time to time. The
Executive has opted out of the Plan. Whilst his status remains so, he will receive in lieu the annual sum of 10% of his current
salary, paid monthly in instalments, together with his salary.
8.2 The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time without replacing it. In this event, and assuming he is, or has
been, a member, the Executive’s rights (if any) will be in accordance with the said trust deeds and rules.
8.3 The Executive has been grated Fixed Protection. The Company acknowledges that once the Executive has informed the Company
that he has Fixed Protection, under Regulation 5D of the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Automatic Enrolment)
Regulations 2010 it does not need to automatically-enrol or automatically re-enrol the Executive into a pension scheme. The
Company therefore agrees not to enrol the Executive in the Plan or any other pension scheme at any time after the Executive has
informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection 2016,
The Company agrees in the meantime that it will not enrol the Executive into the Plan or any other pension scheme unless it is
compelled to do so by law or the parties agree in writing otherwise. If the Company is compelled to enrol the Executive into the
Plan or another pension scheme under law, or the Executive opts to join the Plan or any other pension scheme the Executive
acknowledges and agrees that:
6Table of Contents
(a) the Company has no liability to him if payment of any contribution to, or the provision of any benefit under, the Plan
(whether by itself or when aggregated with any contribution to or any increase in value of the Executive’s rights under
any other arrangement) gives rise to an annual allowance or lifetime allowance charge (within the meaning of the
Finance Act 2004) and that the Company has no responsibility to make any enquiry or advise the Executive as to the
possibility of any such charge;
(b) he is liable for reporting and paying any such charge in accordance with the Finance Act 2004; and
(c) the Company has no liability to him in respect of any loss for any reason of enhanced protection, fixed protection, fixed
protection 2014, fixed protection 2016 or any similar protection allowed in future (for the purposes of the Finance Act
2004) if applicable to the Executive.
9. INSURANCES
9.1 In partial spend of the fixed benefits allowance referred to in sub-clause 6.1, the Executive and his spouse or civil partner and any
children under the age of 21 (or 24 if in full time education) are entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme.
9.2 The Executive is entitled to membership of a Group income protection plan and life assurance cover, which will be paid for by the
Company.
9.3 Participation in all insurance schemes from time to time is subject to:
(a) the terms of the relevant insurance scheme, as amended from time to time;
(b) the rules or the insurance policy of the relevant insurance provider, or WPP Healthcare Trust as amended from time to
time; and
(c) the Executive (and where relevant any other potential beneficiary) satisfying the normal underwriting requirements of the
relevant insurance provider and the premium being at a rate which the Company considers reasonable.
9.4 If the insurer refuses for any reason to provide the benefit to the Executive (or any relevant dependant) the Company shall not be
liable to provide to the Executive any replacement benefit of the same or similar kind or to pay any compensation in lieu of such
benefit. Full details of the insurance schemes are available from the Company’s Worldwide Compensation and Benefits Director.
9.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company’s sole obligations in respect of the insurance benefits referred to in sub clause 9.1 and
9.2 is to pay the premia from time to time requested by the provider and to pay to the Executive any sums as may from time to
time be received by the Company from the provider in respect of any claim made by the Executive (for him or a dependent) under
any insurance scheme.
9.6 The Company shall have the right at its sole discretion to alter the cover provided or any term of any insurance scheme or to
cease to provide (without replacement) any insurance scheme or cover at any time.

obligations under this Agreement shall belong to and vest in the Company.

or has a right to receive, remuneration from any source in respect of his employment or the provision of his services during the

15.5 If the Executive obtains alternative employment or an alternative engagement during the Payment Period any further monthly
instalments of the Payment in Lieu will be reduced on a pro rata basis by any payment or remuneration in respect of such

Group;

the Company may by written notice to the Executive terminate this Agreement with immediate effect.
15.9 The Company’s rights under clause 15.8 are without prejudice to any other rights that it might have at common law to terminate
the Appointment or to accept any breach of this Agreement by the Executive as having brought the agreement to an end. Any
delay by the Company in exercising its rights shall not constitute a waiver thereof.
15.10 On the Termination Date or, at the request of the Board on either party giving notice to terminate this Agreement, the Executive will
immediately:
(a) deliver to the Company all other property in his possession, custody or under his control belonging to any Group

accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme and the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation for the loss of any
rights or benefits under such scheme.
15.12 If the Appointment is terminated for the purpose of the reconstruction or amalgamation of the Company or by reason of the
Company transferring all or a substantial part of its business to another company and the Executive is offered employment by the

claim
13Table of Contents
against the Company or such reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company in respect of the termination of the
Appointment.
16. GARDEN LEAVE
16.1 Following service of notice to terminate the Appointment by either party or if the Executive purports to terminate the Appointment
in breach, the Board may suspend all or any of the Executive’s duties and powers for such periods and on such terms as he
considers expedient and this may include a term that:
(a) the Executive must stay away from all or any of the Company’s premises, and/or
(b) will not be provided with any work, and/or
(c) will have no business contact with all or any of the Group’s agents, employees, customers, clients, distributors and

16.2 During any period of Garden Leave the Company will continue to pay the Executive’s salary, benefits allowance and maintain the
benefits to which he is contractually entitled prior to the commencement of his Garden Leave (for the avoidance of doubt the
Executive shall not be entitled to any bonus or discretionary payment(s) during any period of Garden Leave).
16.3 During any period of Garden Leave may appoint a replacement to exercise any of the Executive’s duties and responsibilities and
may require the Executive to take such actions as he reasonably requires to effect a proper handover of any of his duties and
responsibilities. Alternatively, the Company may require the Executive to carry out exceptional duties or special projects outside
the normal scope of his duties and responsibilities (provided such projects are broadly commensurate with his status).
16.4 During any period of Garden Leave the Executive’s employment will continue and the Executive will continue to be bound by his
obligations under this Agreement and by his general duties of fidelity and good faith (and, where applicable, as a fiduciary). The
Executive agrees that the Company may, if it so chooses, announce to third parties that the Executive has resigned or been given
notice (as the case may be) but the Executive will not make any comment on his status or change of duties, except to confirm he
is on garden leave.

Company without any claim for compensation.

in the form set out in Schedule 1 so that the Company can give effect to the provisions of sub clause 17.3 above and clause 14
above as required.
14Table of Contents
17.5 In the event that the Executive fails to be re-elected as a director of any Group Company, or if the Executive resigns as a director
of any Group Company at the Company’s request, this Agreement shall not automatically terminate and the Executive will
continue as an employee of the Company unless and until either party elect to terminate the employment (either in accordance
with clause 15.1, or where the Company may have a right to terminate his employment summarily under clause 15 or at common
law).
17.6 The Executive must not resign from any directorship or office of any Group Company, except on termination of this Agreement (by
either party), on the Board’s request or as provided in the articles of association of the Company, and he must not do anything that
would cause him to be disqualified from continuing to act as a director.
18. PROTECTIVE COVENANTS
18.1 The Executive acknowledges that his senior position with the Company and any Group Company gives him access to and the
benefit of confidential information vital to the continuing business of the Company and any Group Company and influence over and
connection with the Company’s customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents, employees, workers, consultants and directors
and those of any Group Company in or with which the Executive is engaged or in contact and acknowledges and agrees that the
provisions in Schedule 3 are reasonable in their application to him and necessary but no more than sufficient to protect the
interests of the Company and any Group Company.
18.2 If any person offers to the Executive any arrangement, contractual or otherwise, and whether paid or unpaid, which might or would
cause the Executive to breach any of the covenants in Schedule 3, he will notify that person of the terms of that Schedule 3 and
provide that person with a complete copy of it.
19. DATA PROTECTION
19.1 The Company takes its data protection obligations very seriously and complies with its legal obligations under the General Data
Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018 to protect the privacy and security of the Executive’s personal information.
As a data controller the Company is required to inform the Executive how we hold and use his information.
20. GRIEVANCE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE
20.1 If the Executive is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to him, including any decision to dismiss him, he will have the
right to appeal to the Chairman of WPP plc, whose decision will be final.
20.2 If the Executive seeks to redress any grievance relating to his employment, the Executive should raise this in the first instance
with the Chairman. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, the Executive should then apply in writing to the Board and the
Board’s decision will be final.
20.3 The Company may suspend the Executive from any or all of his duties for as long as is reasonably necessary to investigate any
matter in which the Executive is implicated or involved, whether directly or indirectly, or in the event that the Company believes that
the Executive’s presence in the office would be detrimental to any investigation or to other employees or to the Executive. The
provisions of clause 16.1 (a) to (d) and 16.2 will apply during any such period of suspension, with any additional terms depending
on the circumstances that may be notified to the Executive in writing at that time.

INCENTIVE PLANS
The Executive will be eligible to participate in each of the Incentive plans referred to below in accordance with the rules of the relevant plans

bonus or payment in any subsequent year.
1 SHORT TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (STIP)
1.1 The Executive’s STIP target award will be up to 112% of base salary with a potential award of up to a maximum of 225% of basic

1.4 In the event the Executive’s employment is terminated or he is under notice of termination, whether such notice is given or
received by the Company, prior to the date on which the bonus is paid (in respect of the cash element) or prior to the vesting date

Plan.
3.2 The Company currently expects that the Executive will be granted a target award under the EPSP of WPP plc stock of 300% of
his base salary (but this is subject always to the discretion of the
18Table of Contents
Compensation Committee and may be adjusted downwards prior to the grant being made) which will vest subject to performance (as
deemed by the Compensation Committee in its discretion) at the end of the performance period.

Agreement will be cancelled; and/or (ii) any STIP award or part of a STIP award paid to him in satisfaction of any STIP award

IT systems, data, records and processes to its IT environment or infrastructure (the “ Migration Plan”).
Section 2.2 Performance by Affiliates or Subcontractors . Either Party may, in its sole discretion, engage, or cause one of their Affiliates to engage,
one or more parties (including other third parties or Affiliates) to provide some or all of the Services; provided , (i) such Party is using such Affiliate or
third party to perform the same Services for itself and its Affiliates (to the extent applicable), (ii) such arrangement would not increase the cost to
Recipient for such Services, and (iii) if such third party is not already engaged with respect to such Service as of the date hereof, Provider shall obtain the

such parties and (y) in all cases remain responsible for ensuring that obligations with respect to the standards of Services set forth in Article III of this
Agreement are satisfied with respect to any Services provided by such Affiliate or third party.

provided by RGHI and its Affiliates providing Services hereunder, certain of the Services may involve processes that directly or indirectly support
financial information that the Company includes within its consolidated financial reports. The Company has an obligation to ensure that it has internal
controls over financial reporting that comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and must also ensure that its external auditors can complete their
necessary evaluation of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with auditing standards issued by the U.S. Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Company and RGHI and such Affiliates shall use reasonable commercial efforts to agree (i) what key
controls over financial reporting will be performed by RGHI and such Affiliates within the processes that directly or indirectly support financial

RGHI’s or its Affiliates’ business, to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the key controls; and (2) upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice to RGHI,
perform (through its external auditor) audit procedures over RGHI’s internal controls and procedures for the Services provided under this Agreement;
provided that such right to audit shall exist solely to the extent reasonably required by Company’s external auditors to ensure Company’s compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Company shall pay or reimburse all of RGHI’s expenses and costs arising from such audit. The performance of the
agreed key controls, preparation of documentation, providing access to the Company or its delegate and the Company’s auditors will be billed at the

SERVICE LEVELS; SERVICE COORDINATORS; TSA COMMITTEE

(a) Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects to that at which such Services were
performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and
(ii), the “Service Standard ”). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall
remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are
not professional service providers of the Services.
(b) In the event of any material failure of a Provider to perform the Services, as applicable, in accordance with the Service Standards,
Recipient shall provide Provider with written notice of such material failure, and Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such
failure as soon as reasonably possible and in the same manner that Provider would remedy such a failure for their other businesses undergoing
such a material failure.
(c) A Provider may, from time to time: (i) reasonably supplement, modify, upgrade, substitute or otherwise alter (“Change”) any Service in a
manner consistent with Changes made with respect to similar services provided by Provider on their own behalf or to their Affiliates, including
taking any physical or information security measures with respect to such Service, in a manner that does not (x) adversely affect in any material
respect the quality or availability of such Service or (y) materially increase the fees payable in connection with such Changed Service; provided
that to the extent that any such Change is reasonably likely to modify, substitute or otherwise alter the receipt or use of such Service, Provider shall
provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice of the implementation of the Change to the extent practicable under the circumstances;
provided , further, that the Service Standard shall continue to apply to such Service following any Change. If a Change is required by applicable
Law or is in response to a threatened Security Incident, Provider may make any and all changes to the Service necessary to comply with applicable
Law and any changes thereto or to respond to such threatened Security Incident in a manner consistent with responses made by Provider on its
own behalf or in respect of their Affiliates; provided  that Provider shall provide Recipient such reasonable advance written notice of the
implementation of any such Change as may be practicable under the circumstances; and (ii) with reasonable advance written notice to Recipient,
temporarily suspend the provision of a Service as necessary to conduct Systems maintenance or patching without such suspension constituting a
breach of the Service Standard.
Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020(d) A Provider need not provide any Service if it is not permitted to do so by applicable Law. To the extent that any Service is not permitted
pursuant to applicable Law, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into arrangements reasonably acceptable to each of the Parties under
which the Recipient would obtain the benefit of such Service to the same extent (or as nearly as practicable) as if such Service were permitted by
applicable Law.
Section 3.2 Policies. Each Party shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates or third parties providing or receiving Services (as the case may be) to,
follow the reasonable policies, procedures and practices of the other Party and its Affiliates applicable to the Services that are known or made known to
such Party. A failure of a Recipient to act in accordance with this Section 3.2 that prevents a Provider from providing a Service hereunder shall, upon
reasonable advance written notice to the Recipient (where practicable), relieves Provider of its obligations under the Service until such time as the failure
has been cured.
Section 3.3 Service Coordinators and Dispute Resolution .
(a) RGHI and Company shall each nominate a representative to act as the primary contact person with respect to the performance of the
Services (each, a “Service Coordinator”). Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, the Parties shall direct all initial communications relating to
this Agreement and the Services to the Service Coordinators. The initial Service Coordinators for RGHI and Company, including their contact
information, are set forth on Exhibit C. Either Party may replace its Service Coordinator at any time by providing notice and contact information for
the newly designated Service Coordinator in accordance with Section 10.5. The Service Coordinators shall oversee the implementation and ongoing
operation of this Agreement. The Parties shall ensure that their respective Service Coordinators shall meet in person or telephonically at such times
as are reasonably requested by RGHI or Company to review and discuss the status of, and any issues arising in connection with, the Services or
this Agreement.
(b) In the event a dispute arises between the Parties under this Agreement, telephonic negotiations shall be conducted between the Parties’
respective Service Coordinators within ten (10) days following a written request from any Party (“ Dispute Negotiations ”). If the Service
Coordinators are unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) days after the Parties have commenced Dispute Negotiations, then either RGHI or the
Company, by written request to the other Party, may request that such dispute be referred for resolution to the respective presidents (or similar
position) of the divisions implicated by the matter for the Parties, or more senior executive of a Party if such Party so designates, which presidents
(or other executives) will have fifteen (15) days to resolve such dispute. If the presidents of the relevant divisions (or other executives) for each
Party do not agree to a resolution of such dispute within fifteen (15) days after the reference of the matter to them, or if the dispute is not otherwise
resolved in a friendly manner as set forth in this Section 3.3, then any unresolved dispute may be resolved pursuant to Section 10.8.
Source: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020Section 3.4 Limitation of Services Provided. Except to the extent required to meet the Service Standards, in providing the Services, the Parties are
not obligated to: (i) hire any additional employees; (ii) maintain the employment of any specific employee; (iii) purchase, lease or license any additional
equipment or software; or (iv) make any capital investment to provide or continue providing the Services. The Parties have no responsibility to verify the
correctness of any information given to them on behalf of the other Party for the purposes of providing the Services.
Section 3.5 Third Party Licenses and Consents . The Parties will cooperate and assist each other, and use commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain,
or direct its Affiliates to obtain, any third party consents required under the terms of any agreement between a Party or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and a third party, on the other hand, in order for a Party or its Affiliates to provide the Services during the Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the provision of any Service as contemplated by this Agreement requires the consent, license or approval of any third party not previously obtained, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as promptly as possible after the Commencement Date, any third party consents, permits,
licenses and approvals required under the terms of any third party agreement in order for Provider to provide the Services hereunder. The cost of
obtaining any consent, permit, license or approval with respect to any Service shall be borne by the Recipient of the relevant Services. If any such
consent, permit, license or approval is not obtained, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into reasonably acceptable arrangements under which
Recipient would obtain the benefit of such Service to the same extent (or as nearly as practicable) as if such consent were obtained (at Recipient’s cost),
and each Party will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such required consent or amendment. The Parties acknowledge that it

This is to confirm that, in consideration of the agreements hereinafter contained, the undersigned, the Integrity Short Term
Government Fund, (the “Fund”), an open-end, diversified, management investment company organized as a series of The Integrity
Funds, a Delaware statutory trust, has agreed that Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC, (“Integrity”), shall be, for the period of this
distribution agreement (the “Agreement”), the principal underwriter of shares issued by the Fund, including such classes of shares
as may now or hereafter be authorized (the “Shares”).
SECTION 1. SERVICES AS UNDERWRITER
Section 1.1 Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of the Shares covered by the registration statement,
prospectus, and statement of additional information then in effect of the Fund (the “Registration Statement”) under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).
Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as
determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is
reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have
received purchase orders therefore.
Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,
including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or
by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund’s Registration Statement.
Section 1.4 Integrity will provide one or more persons during normal business hours to respond to telephone questions concerning
the Fund.
Section 1.5 Integrity acknowledges that, whenever in the judgment of the Fund’s officers such action is warranted for any reason,
including, without limitation, market, economic, or political conditions, those officers may decline to accept any orders for, or make
any sales of, the Shares until such time as those officers deem it advisable to accept such orders and to make such sales.
Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein,
shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to
enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such
amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Except as may otherwise
be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers. Shares
sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund’s then current Registration
Statement. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be the net asset value used in determining
the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares.

Services Plan (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the
Fund’s Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.
Section 1.8 Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution
expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “distribution expenses” of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne
by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent
payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following:

any other actions that may be reasonably necessary in connection with the qualification of the Shares for sale in those states that
Integrity may designate.
Section 2.2 The Fund shall furnish from time to time, for use in connection with the sale of the Shares, such information reports
with respect to the Fund and its Shares as Integrity may reasonably request, all of which shall be signed by one or more of the
Fund’s duly authorized officers; and the Fund warrants that the statements contained in any such reports, when so signed by one or
more of the Fund’s officers, shall be true and correct. The Fund shall also furnish Integrity upon request with: (a) annual audits of
the Fund’s books and accounts made by independent public accountants regularly retained by the Fund, (b) semi-annual unaudited

Section 3.1 The Fund represents to Integrity that all registration statements, prospectuses, and statements of additional information
filed by the Fund with the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act with respect to the Shares of the Fund have been carefully
prepared in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.
As used in this Agreement, the terms “registration statement,” “prospectus,” and “statement of additional information” shall mean
any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any
amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to
Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement
becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of
additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration
statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include
an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares. Integrity may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time
such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement
of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of Integrity’s counsel, be necessary or
advisable. If the Fund shall not propose such amendment or amendments and/or supplement or supplements within fifteen days
after receipt by the Fund of a written request from Integrity to do so, Integrity may, at its option, terminate this Agreement. The
Fund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional
information without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall in any way limit the Fund’s right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or
supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable,
such right being in all respects absolute and unconditional.

Section 4.1 The Fund authorizes Integrity and any dealers with whom Integrity has entered into dealer agreements to use any
prospectus or statement of additional information furnished by the Fund from time to time in connection with the sale of Shares.
The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity
within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and
expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in
connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the
1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any
prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading;
provided, however, that the Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall
not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or
representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained
in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are
furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity and
the Fund’s representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the
Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity’s reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement. The Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid,
is expressly conditioned upon the Fund’s being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such
controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot,
North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other
first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any
liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund’s indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The
Fund’s indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund’s representations and warranties in this Agreement
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and
governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares. This agreement of indemnity will inure exclusively
to Integrity’s benefit, to the benefit of its several officers and governors, and their respective estates, and to the benefit of the
controlling persons and their successors. The Fund agrees to notify Integrity promptly of the commencement of any litigation or
proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or trustees in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares.

the Fund within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,
liabilities, and expenses (including the costs of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees
incurred in connection therewith) that the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933
Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, but only to the extent that such liability or expense incurred by the Fund, its
officers or trustees, or such controlling person resulting from such claims or demands shall arise out of or be based upon (a) any
unauthorized sales literature, advertisements, information, statements, or representations or (b) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and used in the answers to any of
the items of the registration statement or in the corresponding statements made in the prospectus or statement of additional
information, or shall arise out of or be based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such
information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and required to be stated in such answers or necessary to make such
information not misleading. Integrity’s agreement to indemnify the Fund, its officers and trustees, and any such controlling person,

or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or telegram addressed to Integrity at its principal office in
Minot, North Dakota, and sent to Integrity by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons
or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify Integrity of any such action shall not relieve Integrity from
any liability that Integrity may have to the Fund, its officers or trustees, or to such controlling person by reason of any such untrue
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of Integrity’s indemnity agreement contained
in this paragraph 4.2. Integrity agrees to notify the Fund promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against
Integrity or any of its officers or governors in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares.

indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it
shall wish to do so, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. If the indemnifying party opts
to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than (a) reasonable costs of
investigation or the furnishing of documents or witnesses and (b) all reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to such
indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the
indemnified party shall have concluded reasonably that representation of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the
same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them in the conduct of the defense of
such action.
SECTION 5. EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION
Section 5.1 None of the Shares shall be offered by either Integrity or the Fund under any of the provisions of this Agreement and
no orders for the purchase or sale of the Shares hereunder shall be accepted by the Fund if and so long as the effectiveness of the

Fund’s obligation to repurchase Shares from any shareholder in accordance with the provisions of the Fund’s prospectus,

or statement of additional information then in effect or that requires the making of a change in such registration statement,
prospectus, or statement of additional information in order to make the statement therein not misleading; and
(d) of all actions of the SEC with respect to any amendment to any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional
information which may from time to time be filed with the SEC.

that the Fund or the underwriter receives notice by 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on such Business Day.
If the Administrator is somehow prohibited from submitting redemption and settlement instructions to the Fund for Fund shares via the NSCC’s
DCC&S platform the following shall apply to this Section:
The Trust agrees to redeem for cash, upon the Administrator’s request, any full or fractional shares of the Fund held by the Administrator on behalf
of a Separate Account, executing such requests on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt and acceptance by the Fund or
its designee of the request for redemption. For purposes of this Section, the Administrator shall be the designee of the Fund for receipt of requests
for redemption from each Separate Account and receipt by such designee shall constitute receipt by the Fund; provided the Fund or the
underwriter receives notice of such request for redemption by 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the next following Business Day. Payment shall be in
federal funds transmitted by wire to the Separate Account as designated by the Administrator, on the same Business Day the Fund or the
underwriter receives notice of the redemption order from the Administrator provided that the Fund or the underwriter receives notice by 10:00 a.m.
Eastern Time on such Business Day.
The Administrator will place separate orders to purchase or redeem shares of each Fund.
35. Maintenance of Records . The Trust or its designee and Administrator shall maintain and preserve all records as required by law to be
maintained and preserved in connection with providing the Services and in making Shares available to the Plans. Upon the request of the Trust or
its designee, Administrator shall provide copies of all the historical records relating to transactions between the Funds and the Plans, written
communications regarding the Funds to or from such Plans and other materials, in each case (i) as are maintained by Administrator in the ordinary
course of its business and in compliance with laws and regulations governing transfer agents, and (ii) as may reasonably be requested to enable
the Trust or its representatives, including without limitation its auditors or legal counsel, to (a) monitor and review the Services, (b) comply with any
request of a governmental body or self-regulatory organization or a Plan, (c) verify compliance by Administrator with the terms of this Agreement,
(d) make required regulatory reports, or (e) perform general customer supervision. Administrator agrees that it will permit the Trust or such
representatives to have reasonable access to its personnel and records in order to facilitate the monitoring of the quality of the Services.
6. Compliance with Laws . At all times, Administrator shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to a transfer agent under
the Federal securities laws, including without limitation, requirements for delivery of prospectuses (which term includes prospectus supplements).
Whether or not required by applicable law, Administrator shall deliver or arrange for the delivery of prospectuses to Plan Representatives and to
Participants in Participant-directed Plans. Without limiting the foregoing: Administrator will be responsible for compliance with Regulation S-P, as
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Administrator will adopt and maintain an anti-money laundering program in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, including provisions for necessary currency transaction reporting, detection of suspicious activities that could
give rise to money laundering, and knowing Administrator’s customers. In connection with the services contemplated in this Agreement,
Administrator will identify sources of potential money laundering and notify the Fund or its agent of any potential areas that would reasonably
raise concerns about the existence of money laundering or unlawful activity.
7 Representations With Respect to Funds . Administrator and its agents and representatives shall not make any representations
concerning a Fund or the Shares except those contained in the then-current prospectus of such Fund and in current Fund sales literature.
8. Fund Representations . The Trust represents and warrants that (i) Fund shares sold pursuant to this Agreement shall be registered
under the 1933 Act and duly authorized for issuance in accordance with applicable law and that the Fund is and shall remain registered under the
1940 Act for as long as the Fund shares are sold; (ii) the Fund shall amend the registration statement for its shares under the 1933 Act and the 1940
Act from time to time as required in order to effect the continuous offering of its shares; and (iii) the Fund shall register and qualify its shares for
sales in accordance with the laws of the various states only if and to the extent deemed advisable by the Fund.
The Trust represents that each Fund (a) is currently qualified as a Regulated Investment Company under Subchapter M of the Code; (b) will make
every effort to maintain such qualification (under Subchapter M or any successor or similar provision); and (c) will notify the Administrator
immediately upon having a reasonable basis for believing that such Fund has ceased to so qualify or might not so qualify in the future.
49. Fund Prospectuses . The Trust shall provide the Administrator at no charge with as many printed copies of the Fund’s current
prospectus and statement of additional information as the Administrator may reasonably request. If requested by the Administrator, in lieu of
providing printed copies of the Fund’s current prospectus and statement of additional information, the Trust shall provide camera-ready film,
computer diskettes, e-mail transmissions or PDF files containing the Fund’s prospectus and statement of additional information, and such other
assistance as is reasonably necessary in order for the Administrator once each year (or more frequently if the prospectus and/or statement of
additional information for the Fund are amended during the year) to have the prospectus for the Contracts (if applicable) and the Fund’s prospectus
printed together in one document or separately. The Administrator may elect to print the Fund’s prospectus and/or its statement of additional
information in combination with other fund companies’ prospectuses and statements of additional information.
The Trust shall provide the Administrator at no charge with copies of the Fund’s proxy statements, Fund reports to shareholders, and other Fund
communications to shareholders in such quantity as the Administrator shall reasonably require for distributing to Contract owners.
The Trust shall pay for the cost of typesetting, printing and distributing all Fund prospectuses, statements of additional information, Fund reports
to shareholders and other Fund communications to Contract owners and prospective Contract owners. The Trust shall pay for all costs for
typesetting, printing and distributing proxy materials.
Each Fund’s statement of additional information shall be obtainable by Contract owners from the Trust, the Administrator or such other person as
the Trust may designate.
10. Relationship of Parties . Except to the extent provided in Section 4 that the Administrator is the agent of the Trust for the limited
purpose of receiving orders and transmitting those orders to the Trust, it is understood and agreed that all Services performed hereunder by
Administrator shall be as an independent contractor and not as an employee or agent of the Trust or its designee, and none of the parties shall hold
itself out as an agent of any other party with the authority to bind such party.
11. Price Errors.
(a) Notification. If an adjustment is required in accordance with a Fund’s then current policies on reimbursement (“Fund
Reimbursement Policies”) to correct any error in the computation of the net asset value of Fund shares (“Price Error”), Trust or its designee shall
notify the Administrator as soon as practicable after discovering the Price Error. Notice may be made via facsimile or via direct or indirect systems
access and shall state the incorrect price, the correct price and, to the extent communicated to the Fund’s other shareholders, the reason for the
price change.
(b) Underpayments , If a Price Error causes an Account to receive less than the amount to which it otherwise would have been
entitled, Trust shall make all necessary adjustments (subject to the Fund Reimbursement Policies) so that the Account receives the amount to
which it would have been entitled.
5(c) Overpayments . If a Price Error causes an Account to receive more than the amount to which it otherwise would have been
entitled, the Administrator, when requested by Trust or its designee (in accordance with the Fund Reimbursement Policies), shall use its best efforts
to collect such excess amounts from the applicable customers.
(d) Fund Reimbursement Policies. Trust agrees to treat the
Administrator’s customers no less favorably than Trust treats other Fund shareholders in applying the provisions of paragraphs 9(b) and 9(c).
12. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate
(a) at the option of any party, upon 90 days’ advance written notice to the other parties hereto; or
(b) in the event of a material breach that has not been cured within ten days following a written notice of breach to the breaching
party.
The provisions of Sections 5, I l, 13 and 14 shall survive any termination of this agreement.
13. Effect of Termination. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Administrator may require the Trust to continue to
make available additional shares of the Fund for so long after the termination of this Agreement as the Administrator desires pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as provided in paragraph (b) below, for all Contracts in effect on the effective date of termination of this
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “ Existing Contracts”), unless such further sale of Fund shares is proscribed by law, regulation or an
applicable regulatory body. Specifically, without limitation, the owners of the Existing Contracts shall be permitted to direct reallocation of
investments in the Fund, redeem investments in the Fund and/or invest in the Fund upon the making of additional purchase payments under the
Existing Contracts unless such further sale of Fund shares is proscribed by law, regulation or an applicable regulatory body. Nothing in this
Agreement, however, shall restrict or prohibit the Trust from discontinuing the offering of shares of any Fund to new investors or from liquidating
any Fund in accordance with state and federal laws and its organizational documents upon approval by the Board of Trustees of the Trust.
The Trust shall remain obligated to pay Administrator the fee in effect as of the date of termination for so long as shares are held by the Accounts
and Administrator continues to provide services to the Accounts. Such fee shall apply to shares purchased both prior to and subsequent to the
date of termination. This Agreement, or any provision thereof, shall survive the termination to the extent necessary for each party to perform its
obligations with respect to shares for which a fee continues to be due subsequent to such termination.
14. Indemnification . Administrator agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trust’s administrators, investment adviser, and
transfer agent, and each of their directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents and each person, if any, who controls them within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which an indemnitee
may become subject insofar as those losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i)
any orders that are not timely transmitted by Administrator in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement or any trades that are cancelled
6by the Trust or its designee based upon payments for purchases of Shares that are not timely wired; (ii) Administrator’s negligence or willful
misconduct in performing the Services; (iii) any breach by Administrator of any material representation, warranty or covenant made in this
Agreement; or (iv) any requests that are submitted by duly authorized representatives of Administrator on behalf of Participants or Plan
Representatives for transaction adjustments (including, but not limited to, the pricing of net purchases or net redemptions of Shares on an “as of”
basis). Administrator will reimburse the indemnities for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by them in connection with
investigating or defending such losses, claims or actions.
Trust agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrator and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
(hereinafter “Administrator Indemnified Parties”), against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities to which Administrator may become
subject (i) as a result of any untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Fund’s prospectus or statement of additional information, as amended
or supplemented from time to time, or the omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or in any sales related materials provided to Administrator intended for dissemination to its Clients; (ii) failure to keep the registration of
the shares and the prospectus by which they are sold current or to otherwise materially comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with such sales; or (iii) the Trust’s willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance or
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent the losses are a result of the negligence, willful misconduct or breach of
this Agreement by an Administrator Indemnified Party.
In any event, neither party shall be liable for any special, consequential or incidental damages.
15. Additional Representations, Warranties and Covenants . Each party represents that (a) it is free to enter into this Agreement and that
by doing so it will not breach or otherwise impair any other agreement or understanding with any other person, corporation or other entity and (b) it
has full power and authority under applicable law, and has taken all action necessary, to enter into and perform this Agreement. Administrator
further represents, warrants and covenants that:
(i) the arrangements provided for in this Agreement will be disclosed to the Plans through their representatives;
it will not be a “fiduciary” of any Plan with respect to the provision of the Administrative Services, the Services or with respect to
a Plan’s purchase of Shares, as such term is defined in Section 3(21) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”);
(iii) it is not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a transfer agent under the 1934 Act or any applicable state securities laws,
including as a result of entering into and performing the Services set forth in this Agreement; and
(iv) it has adopted and implemented internal controls reasonably designed to prevent instructions received from Participants or Plan
Representatives on a
7given Business Day after the Close of Trading from being aggregated with the order for net purchases or net redemptions of
Shares for that Business Day.
The Trust further represents, warrants and covenants that the Trust is registered as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, and its Shares are registered under the Securities Act.

SERVICE AGREEMENT
This Agreement is entered into and effective as of the 1st day of January, 1998, by and between FIDELITY
INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC. (“FIIOC”) and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND
ANNUITY CORPORATION (“Company”).
WHEREAS, FIIOC provides transfer agency and other services to Fidelity’s Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable
Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III (collectively “Funds”); and
WHEREAS, the services provided by FIIOC on behalf of the Funds include responding to inquiries about the Funds
including the provision of information about the Funds’ investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, etc.; and
WHEREAS, Company holds shares of the Funds in order to fund certain variable annuity contracts, group annuity
contracts, and/or variable life insurance policies, the beneficial interests in which are held by individuals, plan trustees, or
others who look to Company to provide information about the Funds similar to the information provided by FIIOC; and
WHEREAS, the Company and one or more of the Funds have entered into one or more Participation Agreements, under
which the Company agrees not to provide information about the Funds except for information provided by the Funds or their
designees; and
WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company desire that Company be able to respond to inquiries about the Funds from individual
variable annuity owners, participants in group annuity contracts issued by the Company, and owners and participants under
variable life insurance policies issued by the Company, and prospective customers for any of the above; and
WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company recognize that Company’s efforts in responding to customer inquiries will reduce the
burden that such inquiries would place on FIIOC should such inquiries be directed to FIIOC.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows:
1. Information to be Provided to Company. FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through
a designee, information about the Funds’ investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The
content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format
and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of
Section 4.2 of each of the Company’s Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of
the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the
Funds.
2. Use of Information by Company. Company may use the information provided by FIIOC in communications to
individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued
by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial
interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces
shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Participation Agreements with the
Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the
information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC mayneed to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be
conveyed to persons outside the Company.
3. Compensation to Company. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be
handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:
At the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the
Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the
number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum
shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company
during the following month.
Should any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of
a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still
in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily
Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination
of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation
Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be
multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three
hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during
the following month.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ].
4. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Company at any time upon written notice to FIIOC. FIIOC may
terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days’ written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement
immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of
the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall
terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company’s Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and
in such event no notice need be given hereunder.
5. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted under and in accordance
with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
6. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, except that it shall be assigned automatically to any successor to FIIOC as the Funds’
transfer agent, and any such successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have set their hands as of the date first written above.

discretion, at any time upon notice to you. Further, Nationwide or a Fund may, in its sole discretion and without notice, suspend or withdraw the
sale of such Shares, including the sale of such Shares to you for the account of any customer(s). Nationwide, in its sole discretion, may arrange for
the payment to you of the fees under this Agreement directly by the Funds rather than through Nationwide. Quarterly and Other Reports

report of the amounts of compensation received by you hereunder and the services provided for which you received such compensation. In

8. Representations and Warranties
By your written acceptance of this Agreement, you represent, warrant and agree that: (i) all compensation payable to you hereunder is for
administrative support services only; (ii) in no event will any of the compensation payable by Nationwide or the services provided by you
hereunder be primarily intended to result in the sale of any Shares issued by a Fund; (iii) the compensation payable to you hereunder, together with

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the relevant state and federal regulations pursuant thereto, including Regulation S-P, and state privacy laws (all the
foregoing referred to as “Privacy Law”).
4Customer Information means any information contained on an application of a customer (“Customer”) of a Fund or other form and all nonpublic
personal information about a Customer that a party receives from the other party. Customer Information includes, by way of example and not
limitation, name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth and personal financial information.
The parties shall establish and maintain safeguards against the unauthorized access, destruction, loss or alteration of Customer Information in their

disclosure of any Customer Information, the party responsible for the disclosure will immediately notify the other party.
The Servicing Agent represents that it has implemented and maintains a comprehensive written information security program that contains
appropriate security measures to safeguard Customer Information that the Servicing Agent receives, stores, maintains, processes or otherwise
accesses in connection with the provision of services hereunder, including protecting such Customer Information against cyber attack.
The provisions of this Privacy Program section shall survive the termination of the Agreement.
16. Anti-Money Laundering Program

procedures, and controls that comply with the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA Patriot Act) of 2001, (“the ACT”) and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (“BSA”). Each party to this Agreement
acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it has adopted and implemented an Anti-Money Laundering Program that complies and will continue
to comply with all aspects and requirements of the ACT, the BSA, and all other applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Upon request, you shall promptly certify to having such Program that complies with and continues to comply with all aspects and requirements of
the ACT, the BSA, and all other applicable federal, state and local anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Your Program shall include, and Nationwide and the Funds shall rely upon, your policies, procedures and controls to, among other things, (i) verify
the identity (due diligence) of your customers, (ii) maintain records of the information used to identify your customers, (iii) determine if your
customer appears on lists of known or suspected terrorists or associated with known or suspected terrorist organizations (said customer hereinafter
referred to as a “Prohibited Customer”), and (iv) to ensure that Prohibited Customers and foreign shell banks do not maintain investments in any
Fund.
Your Program shall also comply with the Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) for customers who open accounts on or after October 1, 2003, and
as such, shall among other matters provide for the release of customer information to law enforcement agencies, and the filing of Suspicious
Activity Reports (“SARs”), as and if applicable, and in accordance with the ACT. In addition, your Program also shall include procedures for
fulfilling the currency reporting requirements of the ACT and the BSA, as and if applicable.

Shares from such indirect intermediary. In such instance, you agree to inform the Fund whether you plan to perform (i) or (ii).

the extent practicable, the format for any transaction information provided to a Fund should be consistent with the NSCC
Standardized Data Reporting Format. For purposes of this provision, an “indirect intermediary” has the same meaning as in SEC

18.1.3 Limitations on Use of Information. The Funds agree not to use the information received for marketing or any other similar
purpose without your prior written consent.
18.2 Agreement to Restrict Trading . You agree to promptly and fully cooperate with any reasonable request made by the Fund to address

in transactions of the Fund’s Shares (directly or indirectly through your account) that violate policies established by the Fund for the
purpose of eliminating or reducing any dilution of the value of the outstanding Shares issued by the Fund.
18.2.1 Form of Instructions . Instructions must include the TIN, if known, and the specific restriction(s) to be executed. If the TIN

upon information to which the instruction relates.

days after your receipt of the instructions.

provide confirmation as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than ten business days after the instructions have been
executed.

purchases and sales to be deemed to occur at the Share Price for such Business Day, except as provided in 4(c) of the Manual Processing
Procedures. Each Instruction shall be deemed to be accompanied by a representation by the Servicing Agent that it has received proper
authorization from each Client-shareholder whose purchase, redemption, account transfer or exchange transaction is effected as a result of such
Instruction.
Fund/SERV-DCCS Processing Procedures

account transfer and registration instructions from the Servicing Agent electronically through Fund/SERV (“Instructions”) without
supporting documentation from the Client-shareholder. On each Business Day, Nationwide shall accept for processing any Instructions
from the Servicing Agent and shall process such Instructions in a timely manner.
2. Nationwide shall perform any and all duties, functions, procedures and responsibilities assigned to it under this Agreement and as otherwise
established by the NSCC. Nationwide shall conduct each of the foregoing activities in a competent manner and in compliance with (a) all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, including NSCC Fund/SERV-DCCS rules and procedures relating to Fund/SERV; (b) the then-current

obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
3. Confirmed trades and any other information provided by Nationwide to the Servicing Agent through Fund/SERV and pursuant to this Agreement
shall be accurate, complete, and in the format prescribed by the NSCC.

Agreement shall be accurate, complete and, in theformat prescribed by the NSCC. All Instructions by the Servicing Agent regarding each Fund/SERV Account shall be true and correct and

Servicing Agent shall maintain documents required by the Funds to effect Fund/SERV transactions. The Servicing Agent certifies that all
Instructions delivered to Nationwide on any Business Day shall have been received by the Servicing Agent from the Client-shareholder
by the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (“ET”)) on the Exchange (the “Close of Trading”) on such Business Day and that
any Instructions received by it after the Close of Trading on any given Business Day will be transmitted to Nationwide on the next
Business Day.
Manual Processing Procedures
1. On each Business Day, the Servicing Agent may receive Instructions from the Client-shareholder for the purchase or redemption of shares of the
Funds based solely upon receipt of such Instructions prior to the Close of Trading on that Business Day. Instructions in good order
received by the Servicing Agent prior to the close of trading on any given Business Day (generally, 4:00 p.m. ET (the “Trade Date”) and
transmitted to Nationwide by no later than 9:30 a.m. ET the Business Day following the Trade Date (“Trade Date plus One” or “TD+1”),
will be executed at the NAV-based public offering price (“Share Price”) of each applicable Fund, determined as of the Close of Trading on
the Trade Date.
2. By no later than 6:00 p.m. ET on each Trade Date (“Price Communication Time”), Nationwide will use its best efforts to communicate to the
Servicing Agent via electronic transmission acceptable to both parties, the Share Price of each applicable Fund, as well as dividend and
capital gain information and, in the case of Funds that credit a daily dividend, the daily accrual for interest rate factor (mil rate), determined
at the Close of Trading on that Trade Date.
3. As noted in Paragraph 1 above, by 9:30 a.m. ET on TD+1 (“Instruction Cutoff Time”) and after the Servicing Agent has processed all approved
transactions, the Servicing Agent will transmit to Nationwide via facsimile, telefax or electronic transmission or system-to-system, or by a
method acceptable to the Servicing Agent and Nationwide, a report (the “Instruction Report”) detailing the Instructions that were received
by the Servicing Agent prior to the Funds’ daily determination of Share Price for each Fund (i.e., the Close of Trading) on Trade Date.
(a) It is understood by the parties that all Instructions from the Client-shareholder shall be received and processed by the Servicing Agent
in accordance with its standard transaction processing procedures. The Servicing Agent or its designees shall maintain records
sufficient to identify the date and time of receipt of all Client-shareholder transactions involving the Funds and shall make or
cause to be made such records available upon reasonable request for examination by the Funds or its designated representative
or, at the request of the Funds, by appropriate governmental authorities. Under no circumstances shall the Servicing Agent
change, alter or modify any Instructions received by it in good order.(b) Following the completion of the transmission of any Instructions by the Servicing Agent to Nationwide by the Instruction Cutoff Time,
the Servicing Agent will verify that the Instruction was received by Nationwide and trades are pending by utilizing a remote
terminal or such other method acceptable to Nationwide.
(c) In the event that an Instruction transmitted by the Servicing Agent on any Business Day is not received by Nationwide by the
Instruction Cutoff Time, due to mechanical difficulties or for any other reason beyond the Servicing Agent’s reasonable control,
such Instruction shall nonetheless be treated by Nationwide as if it had been received by the Instruction Cutoff Time, provided
that the Servicing Agent retransmits such Instruction electronically (by facsimile transmission or other means mutually agreed
upon) to Nationwide and such Instruction is received by Nationwide’s (or the Distributor’s) financial control representative no
later than 9:30 a.m. ET on TD+1. In addition, the Servicing Agent will place a phone call to a financial control representative of
Nationwide (or the Distributor) prior to 9:00 a.m. ET on TD+1 to advise Nationwide (or the Distributor) that a facsimile
transmission concerning the Instruction is being sent.
(d) With respect to all Instructions, Nationwide (or the Distributor’s financial control representative) will manually adjust a Fund’s records
for the Trade Date to reflect any Instructions sent by the Servicing Agent.
(e) By no later than 4:00 p.m. on TD+1, and based on the information transmitted to Nationwide (or the Distributor’s financial control
representative) pursuant to Paragraph 3(c) above, the Servicing Agent will use its best efforts to verify that all Instructions
provided to Nationwide (or the Distributor’s financial control representative) on TD+1 were accurately received and that the
trades for each Account were accurately completed and the Servicing Agent will use its best efforts to notify Nationwide of any
discrepancies.
4. As set forth below, upon the timely receipt from the Servicing Agent of the Instructions, the Fund will execute the purchase or redemption
transactions (as the case may be) at the Share Price for each Fund computed as of the Close of Trading on the Trade Date.
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all purchase and redemption transactions will settle on TD+1. Settlements will be through net
Federal Wire transfers to an account designated by a Fund. In the case of Instructions which constitute a net purchase order, the
Servicing Agent shall, by 1:00 p.m. ET on TD+1, remit funds to the Fund’s custodian in the amount necessary to cover such net
purchase order. In the case of Instructions which constitute a net redemption order, Nationwide shall, by 1:00 p.m. ET on TD+1,
remit funds to the Servicing Agent in the amount necessary to cover such net redemption order, provided that the Fund reserves
the right to (i) delay settlement of redemptions for up to seven (7) Business Days after receiving a net redemption order in
accordance with Section 22 of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, or (iii) suspend redemptions pursuant to the 1940 Act or
as otherwise required by law. Settlements shall be in U.S. dollars and a Fund may pay redemption proceeds in whole or in part by
a distribution in-kind of readily marketable securities that it holds in lieu of cash in conformity with applicable law or regulations.(b) The Servicing Agent or such other party as may be designated, as record owner of each account (“Record Owner”) will be provided
with all written confirmations required under federal and state securities laws.
(c) On any Business Day when the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System is closed, all communication and processing rules will be
suspended for the settlement of Instructions. Instructions will be settled on the next Business Day on which the Federal Reserve
Wire Transfer System is open. The original TD+1 Settlement Date will not apply. Rather, for purposes of this Paragraph 4(c) only,
the Settlement Date will be the date on which the Instruction settles.
(d) The Servicing Agent shall, upon receipt of any confirmation or statement concerning the accounts, promptly verify by use of the
terminal or by such other method acceptable to Nationwide and the Servicing Agent the accuracy of the information contained
therein against the information contained in the Servicing Agent’s internal record-keeping system and shall promptly, but in no
event not more than seven  days, advise Nationwide in writing of any discrepancies between such information. Nationwide and
the Servicing Agent shall cooperate to resolve any such discrepancies as soon as reasonably practicable.

reasonable efforts to take such action as may be appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such costs or losses.
