Each Preferred Security represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the assets of the Trust, which assets consist solely of the 5.75% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2051 of the Company (the “Debentures”). Certain payments on the Preferred Securities and Common Securities (the “Trust Securities”) are guaranteed (the “Guarantee“) by the Company pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) dated as of December 18, 2001, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as successor guarantee trustee (in such capacity, the “Guarantee Trustee”).

The Trust will, if and to the extent it receives the proceeds of a payment on the Debentures, distribute to the holders of the Preferred Securities all payments so received.  
The Company issued the Warrants pursuant to a Warrant Agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) dated as December 18, 2001, as amended as of September 12, 2008, between the Company and the Warrant Agent.

(e) If none of the holders of Remarketing Securities elects to have Remarketing Securities remarketed in the Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall reasonably determine, in good faith after consultation with the Company, the distribution rate or interest rate, as applicable, that would have been established had a Remarketing been held on the Remarketing Date, and such rate shall be the Reset Rate, and the related modifications to the other terms of the Preferred Securities and to the terms of the Debentures and the Warrants shall be effective as of the Remarketing Date.

Section 6. Conditions to the Remarketing Agent’s Obligations.

(ii) (A) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus any material loss or interference with its business from (I) any governmental or regulatory action, notice, order or decree of a regulatory authority or (II) fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court, in each case, otherwise than as set forth each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus; (B) since such date there has not been any material change in the capital stock, short-term debt or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders’ equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus; and (C) the Company has not declared or paid any dividend on its capital stock, except for dividends declared in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, otherwise than as set forth in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus and, except as set forth or contemplated in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has entered into any transaction or agreement (whether or  
19not in the ordinary course of business) material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.  
(iii) They have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus and, in their opinion (A) the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, did not include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) the Time of Sale Prospectus, as of the Remarketing Date and as of the Remarketing Settlement Date, did not include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (C) the Prospectus, as of the date hereof and as of the Remarketing Settlement Date, did not include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (D) since the Effective Date, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.

(j) From the Commencement Date until the Remarketing Settlement Date, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries (i) shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus or (ii) since such date there shall not have been any change in the capital stock, short-term debt or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, prospects, stockholders’ equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is, in the judgment of Barclays, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Unit Securities being delivered on such Remarketing Settlement Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.  
(k) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company’s or any Significant Subsidiary’s debt securities or financial strength by any “nationally recognized statistical rating  
20organization”, as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Securities Act (except as contemplated by clause (ii)), (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced or privately communicated to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company’s or any Significant Subsidiary’s debt securities or financial strength, other than any downgrade by Fitch that is consistent with its existing negative outlook and as set forth or contemplated in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, and (iii) the Remarketing Securities shall have continued to be rated (x) by Moody’s, Investor Service, Inc., (y) by Standard & Poor’s Corporate Ratings Services, and (x) by A.M. Best Company, Inc.  
(l) On or after the date hereof, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company’s securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of Barclays makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Remarketing Securities being delivered on such Remarketing Settlement Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.  
(m) By the Remarketing Date, the Company will have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  
All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel to the Remarketing Agent. No opinion shall state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). All opinions (other than the opinion referred to in (g) above) shall state that they may be relied upon by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP as to matters of law (other than New York and federal law).  
Section 7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, its officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of the Remarketing Securities), to which the Remarketing Agent or that officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under  
21the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:  
(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any (A) the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) any blue sky application or other document prepared or executed by the Company or the Trust (or based upon any written information furnished by the Company or the Trust) filed in any jurisdiction specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Remarketing Securities under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction (such application, document or information being hereinafter called a “Blue Sky Application”);  
(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (and with respect to the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such issuer free writing prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which such statements are made) not misleading; and  
(iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by the Remarketing Agent in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Remarketing, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above, provided that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or failure to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by the Remarketing Agent through its gross negligence or willful misconduct;  
and shall reimburse the Remarketing Agent and each such officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent or that officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with the written information concerning the Remarketing Agent furnished to the Issuers through the Representatives by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent expressly for inclusion therein (which consists of the  
22information specified in Section 2(c)). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to the Remarketing Agent or to any officer, employee or controlling person of the Remarketing Agent.  
(b) The Remarketing Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, and employees and each of its directors, the Trust and each Trustee and each person, if any, who controls any of the Issuers within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any such Trustee or any such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:  
(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application; or  
(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (and with respect to the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such free writing prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which such statements are made) not misleading;  
but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with the written information furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent specifically for inclusion therein (which consists of the information specified in Section 2(c)), and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any such Trustee or such controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any Trustee or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any such Trustee or any such controlling person.  
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not  
23relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided however, the Remarketing Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Remarketing Agent against the Company under this Section 7 if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Remarketing Agent it is advisable for the Remarketing Agent, its officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, due to the availability of one or more legal defenses to them which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) at any time for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall:  
(i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or  
(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a), 7(b) or 7(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, other than to the extent that such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient due to a failure to provide prompt notice in accordance with Section 7(c), then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof:  
24(i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand from the Remarketing; or  
(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only therelative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other with respect to the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  
The relative benefits received by the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities as of the end of day on the day next preceding the Remarketing Settlement Date less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4(a) and less the expenses paid by the Company pursuant to Section 4(b), on the one hand, and the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to such Section 4(a), plus the expenses paid by the Company pursuant to Section 4(b), on the other hand, bear to such aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total price at which Remarketing Securities distributed in the Remarketing exceed the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  
Section 8. [Reserved]  
Section 9. Dealing in the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent may to the extent permitted by law exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketing Securities  
25may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Trust Agreement or the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may, to the extent permitted by law, also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Issuers as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.  
Section 10. Remarketing Agent’s Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The Remarketing Agent will be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination by the Calculation Agent under the Calculation Agency Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 between the Company and Reinsel & Company LLP, as Calculation Agent, of the Accreted Value or Discount relating to the Preferred Securities and Debentures, as applicable, and will incur no liability to the Company or any holder of Remarketing Securities relating to inaccuracies in calculating such Accreted Value or Discount.  
Section 11. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate (i) the Business Day immediately following the Remarketing Settlement Date, (ii) at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last date of the Remarketing if the Remarketing is not successful or (iii) on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent and the appointment of a new Remarketing Agent. In addition, the obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder may be terminated by it by notice given to the Company prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date immediately preceding the Commencement Date if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 6(i), (j) or (k) shall have occurred.  
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that:  
(x) if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent  
26for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it; and  
(y) if the Remarketing Agent failed or refused to perform its obligations hereunder, without some reason sufficient hereunder to justify the cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder, the Remarketing Agent shall not be relieved of liability to the Company for damages occasioned by its default and shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for any expense.

detailed ledger Statement. If any detailed ledger State- ment is disputed in good faith, the Party owing money will pay the undisputed
portion by the due date and will by such due date provide a written explanation of the basis for the disputed portion to such due date.
The Parties shall endeavor to resolve any disputes promptly, and the disputed amount found due, if any, plus accrued interest at the
Interest Rate shall be paid within three (3) Business Days following resolution of the dispute. All payments under the terms of this
Agreement shall be made in US Dollars and immediately available funds. The Parties shall net all undisputed amounts due and owing on
the same day, and/or past due, arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of
the net amount to the other Party. Interest on late payments shall accrue at the Interest Rate from the due date until the date of payment.

data (the “Roundup Records”) in accordance with the written set of accounting policies (including the currency exchange
methodology used by Monsanto) as shall be provided by Monsanto; provided, that if any change in Monsanto’s accounting
policies would adversely affect the Agent’s Commission (other than in a de minimis amount), the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to change the thresholds and/or the Commission, as appropriate, to eliminate such adverse affect; (ii) collecting, recording and
safeguarding receipts of all receivables and payables, costs or expenses either directly incurred by the Roundup L&G Business or
Allocated thereto by either party pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3 hereof. At all times, the Agent shall make available via
computer and/or original documentation, to the members of the Global Support Team continuous access to the Roundup Records
as appropriate on a need-to-know basis, such access shall include, but not be limited to, daily sales updates and additional
financial reporting with such detail as Monsanto may reasonably request from time to time.
(b) Financial Reporting. The Agent shall provide Monsanto no later than the date that is the earlier of (i) four (4)
business days after the last day of each of the Agent’s fiscal months and (ii) the first business day of each calendar month (which
corresponds to the first work day of Monsanto’s closing period) a full, detailed report by country of the Roundup SKU’s being
sold during the past month, including but not limited to Monsanto SKU identifier, quantity sold, quantity of samples provided free
of charge, total sales value by SKU (in local currency). The
18Agent shall provide to Monsanto monthly financial statements, including (i) the full Roundup P&L (from Gross Sales to EBIT),
balance sheet and cash flow statements, (ii) the Netback expense detail (accruals and actuals), (iii) all other Expense detail
(accruals and actuals), and (iv) Cost of Goods Sold detail. Such monthly financial statements shall be provided (i) in their
preliminary form (due to the closing schedule, the parties acknowledge that these results may be preliminary or final and a
subsequent true-up may occur in the following month) no later than the date that is the earlier of (i) four (4) business days after the
last day of each of the Agent’s fiscal months and (ii) the first business day of each calendar month (which corresponds to the first
work day of Monsanto’s closing period), and (ii) in their final form no later than ten (10) business days following the end of each
calendar month.
(c) Audit. Monsanto shall have the right to periodically audit or have an independent accountant audit, on
Monsanto’s behalf, all the Roundup Records. The audit shall be at the cost of Monsanto unless any material error has been
committed by the Agent, in which case the Agent shall bear the cost of the audit. Upon exercise of its right of audit, and discovery
of any disputed item, Monsanto shall provide written notice of dispute to the Agent. The parties shall resolve such dispute in the
manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.
Section 3.2 Ordering, Invoicing and Cash Flow Cycle .
(a) Ordering and Invoicing. The Agent shall perform, on behalf of Monsanto, all order taking, order processing
and invoicing for the Roundup Products, it being understood that orders filled for Roundup Products shall be invoiced on the
invoices used by the Agent for its other non-Roundup Products provided such invoices or their EDI version shall (i) identify the
Agent as an agent for Monsanto for the sale of all Roundup Products and Monsanto as the actual transferor of title to Roundup
Products; (ii) direct payment of such invoice to be made directly to the account designated by the Agent; and (iii) include all taxes
(other than Income Taxes), duties, and other charges imposed by governmental authorities based on the production or sale of
Roundup Products or their ownership or transportation to the place and time of sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the
Agent utilizes a third-party distributor, in circumstances as the Agent and Monsanto may agree, Monsanto may perform order
taking, order processing and/or invoicing for the Roundup Products as the Agent and Monsanto may mutually agree.
(b) Customer Remittances . Customers of Roundup Products shall be directed, as per the invoices, to remit
directly the invoiced amounts for all Roundup Products to the Agent’s designated bank account. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to customers that are invoiced by Monsanto in accordance with Section 3.2(a), such customers of Roundup Products
shall be invoiced directly by Monsanto and shall remit payment directly to Monsanto the invoiced amounts for all Roundup
Products to an account designated by Monsanto.
(c) Cash Settlement . At the end of each week, the Agent shall verify the actual amount of the Customers’
remittances for the Roundup Products received and Expenses paid over the past week and shall send to Monsanto a weekly
reconciliation statement (the “Reconciliation Statement”) setting forth such information in the form attached hereto as Schedule
3.2(c). Within three business days (or such other time period agreed to by the Agent and Monsanto) of the receipt by Monsanto of
the Reconciliation Statement, Monsanto shall review and approve such
19Reconciliation Statement; provided, that (i) if Monsanto disputes the contents of the Reconciliation Statement, the Agent and
Monsanto shall work in good faith to resolve any such disputes and (ii) any such dispute shall be reconciled and addressed by way
of an adjustment to the cash settlement in the current month or a subsequent month, as mutually agreed to by the Agent and
Monsanto. Upon the approval of the Reconciliation Statement (subject to any agreed to revisions), Monsanto or the Agent, as
applicable, shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds the net amount due to the Agent or to Monsanto, as
applicable. For the purpose of this Section 3.2(c), customer remittances shall be allocated by the Agent to Roundup Products in
proportion to the amount payable by such customer to the Agent in relation Roundup Products to the total amount payable by such
customer to the Agent.
(d) Recognition. The parties acknowledge and agree that all sales by the Agent will be recognized for accounting
purposes at the time when the product to be accounted for as sold has been shipped to the applicable account and its receipt
confirmed. With respect to all buy/sell sales and all other direct account sales, whether by the Agent’s sub-distributors or sub-
agents, such sales will be recognized for accounting purposes at the time when the product to be accounted for as sold has been
shipped to the applicable sub-distributor or sub-agent and its receipt confirmed. Any payments received by the Agent as
Monsanto's agent for sales made in accordance with this Agreement will be remitted to Monsanto in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Agreement as modified by the course of performance of the parties.
(e) Budget. The budget for the Roundup L&G Business shall include both buy/sell sales and direct account sales.
Section 3.3 Expenses and Allocation Rules
(a) Expenses. Each and every Expense, either as a direct expense or an allocated one, shall only be charged to the
Roundup L&G Business and consequently taken into account in the Program EBIT statements set forth in Section 3.6(c) hereto if
part of a category of Expenses specifically authorized by the terms of the Annual Business Plan and within the aggregate amount
prescribed in the Annual Business Plan for such category of Expense (“Budget”) (“Approved Expense”). Any Expense which shall
exceed its prescribed Budget shall solely be the responsibility of the party incurring it unless such expense is required to implement
an approved Significant Deviation from the Annual Business Plan or is necessary to support sales orders above budgeted sales
pursuant to sales programs contemplated by the Annual Business Plan. Expenses shall be classified into (i) direct expenses of the
Roundup L&G Business payable to vendors, or (ii) as Allocated Expenses agreed upon during the Annual Business Plan. Payment
of any direct expenses incurred by either party on behalf of the Roundup L&G business shall be made as they become due in
accordance with the applicable commercial terms agreed upon with each vendor.
(b) Expense Verification. Each party shall have the right to verify whether any particular Expense is an Approved
Expense by sending a written inquiry to that effect to the Agent’s nominee. The party incurring an Expense shall endeavor to
promptly provide upon request of the Agent’s nominee the appropriate documentary evidence supporting such Expense. Upon
failure by the said party to provide the appropriate documentary evidence, the inquiring party shall have the right to send a written
notice of dispute to the other party and the parties shall resolve such dispute
20in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof. Upon determination by such Independent Accountant (as defined below) that the
Expense was not an Approved Expense, such Expense shall be deducted from the Program Expenses and the Agent and
Monsanto shall include an appropriate adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(c). Allocated
Expenses shall be paid no more than three weeks after months’ end in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(c).
(c) Allocation Rules. In the performance of their obligations under this Agreement, each party shall incur
Allocated Expenses directly related to the Roundup L&G Business. Each allocated Approved Expense, regardless of the party
incurring it, shall be reimbursed provided such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the Allocation Rules set forth for each
category of cost and service per country or region, as the case may be, in Schedule 3.3(c) attached hereto (“Allocated Expense”).
Section 3.4 Resolution of Disputes Arising under Article 3 . Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, each party shall
have the right, within twenty (20) days of receipt of the quarterly or annual financial statements to send a written notice of dispute
to the other party. Upon receipt of such notices of dispute, the parties shall undertake the following steps:
(a) First, for a period of fifteen (15) days, the parties shall negotiate in good faith for the purposes of attempting to
mutually agree upon the item in dispute;
(b) Second, if parties are unable to mutually agree upon the item in dispute, then within seven (7) business days
following the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period, the parties shall agree in writing upon the selection of a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm (the “Independent Accountant”) to resolve the dispute. If the parties cannot agree upon
such Independent Accountant within such time frame, then the Independent Accountant shall thereupon be selected by the
American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), with preference being given by the AAA in making such selection to any one of the
“Big Four” accounting firms (except for any firm which performs accounting services for either party) willing to perform the
services required hereunder. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed to act within thirty (30) days to resolve the dispute,
and its decisions with respect to the dispute shall be final and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant with respect to the settlement of the dispute shall be borne equally by the parties.
Section 3.5 Fixed Contribution to Expenses .
(a) Amount and Purpose. Each Program Year the Agent shall make a fixed contribution to the overall Expenses
of the Roundup L&G Business in an amount equal to eighteen million U.S. Dollars ($18,000,000) (“Contribution Payment”). Such
Contribution Payment shall be payable by the Agent to Monsanto in twelve equal monthly installments which shall be due on the
first day of each month and shall not be subject to any “set-off”.
Section 3.6 Commission.
21(a) Amount of Commission. In consideration to the Agent for performance of its duties and obligations hereunder,
the Agent shall be entitled to a Commission (“Commission”). Such Commission shall represent a percentage of the Program EBIT
realized by the Roundup L&G Business which percentage shall be (i) for Program Years 2017 and 2018, 50% of the Program
EBIT and (ii) for Program Years 2019 and thereafter, 50% of the Program EBIT in excess of $40MM (such $40MM threshold,
the “Commission Threshold”). The parties agree that the Commission Threshold may be amended from time to time by mutual
agreement of the parties following the inclusion or exclusion of either new or existing countries in the Included Markets, including
Activated Included Markets, or Excluded Markets, as applicable.
(b) Payment of Commission . Within thirty (30) days following the end of each month, the Agent, on behalf of
Monsanto shall determine whether a Commission becomes payable, i.e., whether the cumulative Program EBIT for the Program
Year up to the preceding month equals an amount in excess of the First Commission Threshold. If so, the Agent, on behalf of
Monsanto shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent’s designated account for the payment of the applicable Commission
pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).
(c) Final Determination. Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each Program Year, the Agent shall deliver
to Monsanto a Commission Statement which shall contain the final determination of the Commission due at the expiry of the
Program Year and shall set forth any eventual adjustments, to the amounts paid up to the Agent under Section 3.6(b) during the
preceding Program Year. If within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto
does not provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the amount of the Commission for such
Program Year shall be as provided thereon. If within such fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by
Monsanto, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the parties shall resolve
such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.
Section 3.7 [Intentionally deleted]
Section 3.8 Additional Commission .
(a) The parties acknowledge that Monsanto currently sells Glyphosate-based products under the Roundup
trademark, directly or indirectly, to professional, industrial and agricultural users (“Roundup Ag Products”). Monsanto
acknowledges that one of such Roundup Ag Products, the 2.5 gallon SKU containing 41% concentration of Glyphosate with the
Brand name Roundup Pro (the “Roundup Pro SKU”), is currently being sold through Lawn and Garden Channels in the United
States and may be purchased by consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market. Monsanto also acknowledges its obligations
pursuant to Section 6.13(b) hereof.
(b) The Agent is exclusively distributing and managing the sale of the Roundup Pro SKU in Lawn and Garden
Channels in the United States. The parties acknowledge that the Agent purchases the Roundup Pro SKU from Monsanto (or a
successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) for the Agent’s own account
in its capacity as a distributor and not as a marketing agent, and the sales resulting from such Roundup
22Pro SKU shall not be included in the Program Sales Revenues hereunder. In the event that the Agent is terminated as an exclusive
distributor of the Roundup Pro SKU by Monsanto (or by a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or
commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU), any subsequent sales of the Roundup Pro SKU by parties other than Agent in the Lawn
and Garden Channels in the United States will be subject to the provisions of Section 3.8(c) below.
(c) Except to the extent provided in Section 3.8(b) above, on and after the Effective Date, Monsanto shall use its
reasonable efforts to ensure that Roundup Ag Products are not sold, directly or indirectly, through Lawn and Garden Channels to
consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets. In the event that in the normal course of business the Agent
determines based on satisfactory evidence that a material amount of additional Roundup Ag Products, above Program Year 2016
sales levels (such amount, the “Historical Threshold”), are being sold directly by Monsanto (or directly by any successor entity
which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) through Lawn and Garden Channels in the
Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to include, subject to the principles set forth in Section 3.8(d), an
appropriate percentage of such incremental sales that exceed the Historical Threshold to reflect such Lawn and Garden Use within
the definition of Program Sales Revenues so that the Agent receives credit therefor for purposes of calculating the Agent’s
Commission, or such other compensation as required to fully compensate the Agent for lost Commission as a result of such sales
of Roundup Ag Products above the Historical Threshold as the Parties may agree (collectively, the “Additional Amount”).
(d) In implementing the foregoing, the parties shall follow the following principles: (i) that Monsanto’s sales of
Roundup Ag Products are not intended for Lawn and Garden Use and that Monsanto shall not sell Roundup Ag Products directly
or promote the indirect sale thereof, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included
Markets and (ii) that there shall be no transfer of historical or future sales of Roundup Ag Products in the Ag Market into Program
Sales Revenues. Furthermore, the parties acknowledge that Roundup Ag Products having a formulation consisting of 41% or more
Glyphosate and in container sizes over 2.5 gallons in the United States or over one liter in the other Included Markets shall be
presumed to have no Lawn and Garden Use and therefor that sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall not be deemed to
compete with Roundup Products in a manner that would justify adjustment of the calculation of Program Sales Revenues; provided
that if the Agent is able to demonstrate to the Steering Committee that a material change in the amount of such Roundup Ag
Products above the Historical Threshold are being sold through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden
Use in the Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith pursuant to Section 3.8(c) to adjust the calculation of
Program Sales Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Agent, any of its Affiliates and/or Seamless Control
LLC (“Seamless Control”), but only if Seamless Control is then controlled by Agent or an Affiliate of Agent, sells, directly or
indirectly, Roundup Ag Products through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the
Included Markets above the Historical Threshold, sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall (i) to the extent in excess of the
Historical Threshold, be added to the Historical Threshold and (ii) not be considered by Monsanto or the Agent when determining
the Additional Amount.
23(e) During the 2014 Program Year and for each Program Year thereafter, in consideration for the Agent’s
marketing, distribution and sales of Roundup 365, for the 2014 Program Year, and for each Program Year thereafter, if 365 Gross
Profits exceed USD $10MM in a Program Year, the Agent shall be paid an amount equal to 7% of the 365 Gross Profits for such
Program Year (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the first USD $10MM of the 365 Gross Profits). The amount that becomes
payable under this Section 3.8(e) with respect to a Program Year shall be included as a separate line item in the Commission
Statements delivered by Agent to Monsanto and the payment of such amount shall be in addition to the Commission otherwise
payable under Section 3.6(b) and shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement except as otherwise
expressly stated in this Section 3.8(e).

Business (as determined by Monsanto) (the “Monsanto Senior Executive”), who shall have the exclusive discretion to resolve the
matter and such decision shall bind the Steering Committee to such action or inaction. Notwithstanding any future assignment of
this Agreement to a third party by reason of a Roundup Sale, the Monsanto Senior Executive shall retain its right of veto in case of
deadlock of the Steering Committee.

in accordance with all applicable Laws.
Section 6.8 Monsanto Inspection Rights. From time to time, as Monsanto or the Steering Committee may request, the
Agent shall permit, upon reasonable request and during normal business hours, representatives of Monsanto or the Steering
Committee to inspect, with regard to Roundup Products, the Agent’s inventories, warehousing, and shipping procedures.
Section 6.9 Recalls. The Agent shall cooperate with Monsanto, and promptly take such actions as requested by
Monsanto, with respect to any defective product including any “stop-sales” or recalls for Roundup Products.
Section 6.10 New Roundup Products.
(a) During the term of this Agreement, Monsanto covenants and agrees to first offer (the “Product Offer”) to the
Agent, with respect to the Included Markets, the exclusive agency and distribution rights to any newly created non-selective
herbicide product, which is not marketed for Lawn and Garden Use as of the date of this Agreement, and which Monsanto, in its
exclusive, reasonable discretion, determines to be suitable for sale as a new product for Lawn and Garden Use (the “New
Product”); provided, however, that for the Lawn and Garden Market, that any new product containing Glyphosate or another non-
selective herbicide shall be considered to be a New Product. The Product Offer shall be in writing, shall be in sufficient detail
describing such New Product, and shall be made within sixty (60) days of the date of commercialization of such New Product for
uses other than Lawn and Garden Use. In no event shall Monsanto, directly or indirectly, commercialize any New Product for
Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets without first offering such New Product to the Agent pursuant to the terms of this
Section 6.10. If the Agent agrees in writing
30within ninety (90) days of receipt of the Product Offer to accept the New Product, then such New Product shall be, without
further action or amendment, included within the definition of Roundup Products and be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. In such event, the parties shall adjust the Commission Thresholds to reflect this additional source of revenue unless the
New Product is a Glyphosate-based product or an improvement of any existing Roundup Products in which case the Commission
Thresholds shall remain the same. If the Agent fails to agree in writing to accept the Product Offer within such ninety (90) days of
receipt, then Monsanto shall have the exclusive right to manufacture, package, promote, distribute, and sell such New Product in
the Included Markets, regardless of any actual or potential conflict with the terms of Agreement.
(b) During the term of this Agreement, the Agent may, from time to time, propose that Monsanto utilize a different
formulation of non-selective herbicide product for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets that may or may not contain
Glyphosate (an “Agent Proposed Product”) and offer the Agent the exclusive agency and distribution rights to such Agent
Proposed Product under this Agreement. Any Agent Proposed Product proposal shall contain supporting detail describing the
Agent Proposed Product. The Agent shall supply Monsanto with any information Monsanto reasonably requests as part of its
evaluation. Monsanto shall not unreasonably delay its evaluation of an Agent Proposed Product following receipt of any such
information. Monsanto shall give good faith consideration to all Agent Proposed Products, and provided that Monsanto shall have
the sole discretion in branding any Agent Proposed Product, Monsanto shall not unreasonably refuse to submit to the Agent a
Product Offer for an Agent Proposed Product under Section 6.10(a) that is, in Monsanto’s reasonable discretion, commercially
attractive, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other material aspects, including, without limitation, any
possible effect of such Agent Proposed Product on Monsanto's overall business and business prospects.
(c) The Agent hereby grants Monsanto an exclusive (even with respect to the Agent and its Affiliates), non-
transferrable, royalty-free license and right to use the trademarks EcoSense and Path Clear  (Trademark Application No.
1430287) in Canada (such trademarks, the “Canada Marks”), only in connection with Natural Products (as defined below) in the
natural non-selective weedkiller category for Lawn & Garden Use during the term of this Agreement. Monsanto agrees to use the
Canada Marks in a manner consistent with the form and style of such trademarks as used by the Agent, or as otherwise agreed in
writing with the Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent currently uses and/or may in the future use the Canada Marks on
products in categories other than non-selective weedkillers for Lawn & Garden Use, and the license granted to Monsanto herein
shall not affect or restrict the Agent’s rights in such other categories. Such license shall terminate automatically upon any expiration
or termination of the term of this Agreement applicable to Canada. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be
interpreted as granting Monsanto a license to the Canada Marks outside of Canada or outside the category specified in this
Section 6.10(c). The Agent represents and warrants that it is a licensee with the right to sublicense the Canada Marks, and that
Monsanto's use of the Canada Marks, as described herein, shall not infringe upon the rights of any third party. The Agent agrees to
hold harmless, indemnify, and defend Monsanto from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from a breach of this warranty by the Agent. The Agent agrees to carry out at its
expense, all procedures necessary to register and maintain the Canada
31Marks in full force and effect and Monsanto agrees to cooperate with the Agent in providing any product sample or other required
information to assist in the maintenance and renewal of the Canada Marks. Monsanto acknowledges OMS Investments, Inc.’s
exclusive ownership of all right, title and interest in and to the Canada Marks and agrees that Monsanto’s use of the Canada
Marks shall inure to the benefit of OMS Investments, Inc. Monsanto further agrees that it will in no way dispute, impugn or attack
the validity of said Canada Marks or OMS Investments, Inc.’s or the Agent’s rights thereto.
(d) The Agent hereby grants to Monsanto exclusive access to the registrations for an acetic acid/citric acid
nonselective weedkiller formulation in Canada. The parties will agree on the mutually acceptable details and mechanics of access
and appropriate registration/labeling rights, the cost of which will be included in the Roundup P&L. Access to the then-current
registrations shall continue in perpetuity, on a nonexclusive basis, following any future termination or expiration of this Agreement,
enabling Monsanto or its successors to market and sell such formulations following such termination under trademarks that are
different from the trademarks licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c).
(e) Together, the respective trademark licenses and registration access provided pursuant to this Section 6.10
result in the following product: an acetic acid/citric acid nonselective weedkiller formulation under the EcoSense brand in Canada
and an acetic acid nonselective weed killer formulation under the Path Clear brand in Canada (collectively, the ”Natural
Products”). Any Natural Product marketed and/or sold under a different brand name in Canada shall be deemed to be a Natural
Product and subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Natural Products will be included in the Roundup P&L and shall be
subject to the same terms, rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement as are the Roundup Products, except as modified by
this Section 6.10. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any improvements to the existing Natural Products
formulations in Canada during the respective term of this Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto access to such improvements
and the improved products will be included in the Roundup P&L on the same terms as agreed for the current formulations of the
Natural Products. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any new natural nonselective weedkiller products
(including, without limitation, any herbicidally active substances which are plant extracts, including those derived from oleic acid or
which are derived from plant extracts by processing including active substances) in Canada during the respective term of this
Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto a right of first refusal to include such new products in the Roundup P&L on the same
terms as agreed for the current Natural Products, and if accepted, such new products will become Natural Products. In the event
that the Agent offers in writing a product to Monsanto pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10(e) and Monsanto does not accept
such product in writing within 90 days of the Agent’s offer, the Agent may market such product at its own discretion utilizing an
alternative trademark from those licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c) (which alternative trademark is not identical or
materially similar to the Canada Trademarks.
(f) The marketing, sale and distribution of each of the Natural Products in Canada shall be governed in all respects
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the calculation of the Commission pursuant to Section
3.6 hereof. Following the inclusion of the Natural Products in the Roundup L&G Business in Canada, and fully consistent
32with the performance standards and requirements of Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement, the performance of the Roundup L&G
Business will be evaluated based on the total results of the business, including from current Roundup Products, the added Natural
Products, and any future products added to the Roundup L&G Business. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Annual
Business Plan, the Agent shall continue to promote Roundup Products in the manner described in Section 2.2(a)(7). The parties
will ensure that marketing, promotional and selling plans promote the sale of the Natural Products in a manner that is consistent
with this Agreement and complementary to Roundup Products, and does not directly or indirectly disparage or advertise against
Roundup Products, as set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, in addition to marketing and selling the Natural Products in such a
manner to existing Customers, the Agent will use its best efforts to target retailers and customers who do not currently purchase
Roundup Products. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent hereby agrees that matters relating to the Naturals Products shall be
included in the Annual Business Plan.
(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the letter agreement dated February 26, 2010
between the Agent and Monsanto shall survive in full force and effect in its entirety.
(h) No provision of this Section 6.10 should be understood, explicitly or implicitly, as an amendment of the
noncompetition provisions of this Agreement, or a relinquishment by either party of their rights or waiver of their obligations except
as expressly set forth in this Section 6.10.

Products Trademarks”) and that it has the right to sublicense each of the Additional Roundup Products Trademarks for the term of
the Additional Roundup Trademarks Licenses and for the purposes set forth therein without reservation. To the Agent's

territories (the “Additional Roundup Products Trademarks
34License”). Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Monsanto shall have no right to use the Additional Roundup
Products Trademarks. Upon such expiration or termination, the Agent will purchase any remaining inventory of the Additional
Roundup Products, including any components thereof, at cost.

Monsanto terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.4(a)(2) or (ii) the Agent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.5(a), the Noncompetition Period shall be deemed to terminate simultaneously upon the effective date of the termination
of this Agreement.
(b) Monsanto Covenant . Except as provided for in Section 3.8, Monsanto covenants and agrees that for the
Noncompetition Period, Monsanto will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or
control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in, as a
shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, any “Competitive Business.” A Competitive Business shall be any business which,
anywhere within the Included Markets, (x) manufactures, sells, markets or
36distributes any non-selective weed control product, whether residual or non-residual, for Lawn and Garden Use or (y) competes
with the Roundup L&G Business; provided, however, this Section 6.13(b) shall not apply to those actions of Monsanto or any
Affiliate (i) to the extent such actions are expressly contemplated by this Agreement, for the duration of this Agreement, (ii) to the
extent that immediately upon termination of this Agreement for whatever reason Monsanto or any Affiliates or successor to the

sales to consumers outside of the Lawn and Garden Market, Monsanto will notify the Agent in writing that it wishes to begin
selling Mexican Roundup Ag Products to such identified business. The Agent will have thirty (30) days to provide any written
objection to Monsanto's request. If the Agent does not object to the request, such identified Exclusive Mexican Business will no
longer remain exclusive to the Agent. If the Agent objects to Monsanto's request, Monsanto shall have the ability to raise its
request to the Steering Committee for final determination. Monsanto shall continue to maintain the right to sell Mexican Roundup
Ag Products, labeled for the Ag Market, regardless of size, to any business that markets and makes sales to the Ag Market in
Mexico, regardless of whether that business also markets and makes sales to consumers for use in, on or around residential
homes, residential lawns and residential gardens, and such sales shall not constitute a violation of Section 6.13(b) of this
Agreement. Monsanto's Mexican Roundup Ag Products shall not be included in the Program Sales Revenue, regardless of SKU
size.
(c) Agent’s Covenant. The Agent covenants and agrees that during the Noncompetition Period, the Agent will
not, nor will it permit any Affiliate to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise,
any Competitive Business; provided, however, this Section 6.13(c) shall not apply to those actions of the Agent or any Affiliate (i)
to the extent such actions are expressly contemplated by this Agreement, for such term of this Agreement; (ii) to the extent such
actions relate to the products listed on Exhibit D hereto in the countries listed therein, the products that the Agent either owns, has
contracted to purchase or entered into a letter of intent with respect to as of the Effective Date and such additional products as the
parties may from time to time agree (the “Permitted Products”); (iii) to the extent that the Agent’s interest in a Competitive
Business, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, is equal to or less than 5%; or (iv) to any separate agreement with
Monsanto with respect to transgenic technology sharing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.13(c), the
Agent shall have the right to market and make sales of Roundup Products labeled for Lawn and Garden Use to any business that
markets and makes sales to Lawn and Garden Channels in Mexico regardless of whether that business also makes sales to the Ag
Market in Mexico, and such sales shall not constitute a violation of Section 6.13(c) of this Section 6.13(c).
(d) Non-Solicitation by Monsanto. Monsanto agrees that for the duration of the Noncompetition Period and for
the two years thereafter, without the prior written consent of the Agent, it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to (i) solicit
for employment any person
37then employed by the Agent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) knowingly employ any employee of the Agent or any of its Affiliates who
voluntarily terminates such employment with the Agent (or such Affiliate) after the Effective Date, until three months have passed
following termination of such employment.
(e) Non-Solicitation by the Agent. The Agent agrees that for the duration of the Noncompetition Period, without
the prior written consent of Monsanto, it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to (i) solicit for employment any person then
employed who works primarily with Roundup Products or with other products with Lawn & Garden Uses (“Lawn & Garden
Employee”) by Monsanto or any of its Affiliates or (ii) knowingly employ any Lawn & Garden Employee of Monsanto or any of its
Affiliates who voluntarily terminates such employment with Monsanto (or such Affiliate) after the Effective Date, until three months
have passed following termination of such employment.
(f) Consideration. The consideration for the agreements contained in this Section 6.13 are the mutual covenants
contained herein, the agreement of the parties to consummate the purchase of the Non-Roundup Assets, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged.
(g) Modification. In the event a court (or other authority) refuses to enforce the covenants and agreements
contained in this Section 6.13, either because of the scope of the geographical area specified in this Section 6.13, the duration of
the restrictions, or otherwise, the parties hereto expressly confirm their intention that the geographical areas covered hereby, the
time period of the restrictions, or such other provision, be deemed automatically reduced to the minimum extent necessary to
permit enforcement.
(h) Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge and agree that the extent of damages to one party (the “non-
breaching party”) in the event of an actual or threatened breach of this Section 6.13 by the other party (the “breaching party”) may
be impossible to ascertain and there may be available to the non-breaching party no adequate remedy at law to compensate the
non-breaching party in the event of such an actual or threatened breach by the breaching party. Consequently, the parties agree
that, in the event that either party breaches or threatens to breach any such covenant or agreement, the non-breaching party shall
be entitled, in addition to any other remedy or relief to which it may be entitled, including without limitation, money damages, to
seek to enforce any or all of such agreements or covenants against the breaching party by injunctive or other equitable relief
ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction.

(a) Monsanto represents and warrants that Monsanto or Affiliates are the exclusive owners of the trademarks,
trade names, packages, copyrights and designs used in the sale of Roundup Products (hereinafter referred to as “Industrial

Industrial Property in the conduct of the Roundup L&G Business, do not infringe or otherwise conflict with any trademarks,
registrations, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, nor has any claim been made that the conduct of the
Roundup L&G Business as now being conducted

Industrial Property so as to tend to alter or dilute such Industrial Property, and the Agent further agrees not to combine or
associate any of such Industrial Property with any other industrial property. The generic or common name of the type of product
(e.g., “non-selective herbicide”) must always follow Roundup Products’ trademarks.
(d) In all advertisements, sales and promotional or other printed matter in which any Industrial Property appears,
the Agent shall identify itself by full name and address and state its relationship to Monsanto. In all such material, the Roundup
trademark shall be identified as a trademark owned by Monsanto Company. In the case of a registered trademark, a ® shall be
placed adjacent to the trademark with the ® referring to a footnote reading “® Registered trademark of Monsanto Company.” In
the case of unregistered trademarks, a “TM” shall be placed adjacent to the trademark with the “TM” referring to a footnote
reading “TM Trademark of Monsanto Company.”

otherwise expressly provided herein, neither party nor any of its directors, employees or agents, or its subcontractors or vendors
shall give to or receive from any director, employee or agent of the other party any gift, entertainment or other favor of significant
value, or any commission, fee or rebate. Likewise, neither party nor its directors, employees or agents or its subcontractors or
vendors shall, without prior written notification thereof to the other party, enter into any business relationship with any director,
employee, or agent of the other party or any of its Affiliates unless such person is acting for and on behalf of such party. Each party
shall promptly notify the other of any violation of this Section 6.15 and any consideration received as a result of such violation shall
be paid over or credited to the other party.

with this Agreement and shall retain all such records for at least forty-eight (48) months following the termination or expiration of
this Agreement. This obligation shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

arbitration tribunal, or judicial, governmental or administrative agency, against the Agent which would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Agent to perform its obligations hereunder or which seeks to prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein.
(e) There are no material disputes with underwriters under the Agent’s insurance policies; each such policy is valid
and enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect; there exists no default by the Agent under any such
policy, and there has been no material misrepresentation or inaccuracy in any application therefor, which default, misrepresentation
or inaccuracy would give the insurer the right to terminate such policy, binder, or fidelity bond or to refuse to pay a claim
thereunder; and the Agent has not received notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any such policy.

ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its
employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), damage,
injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or
threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage
to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (“Loss”), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from
the indemnifying party’s actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void
or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the “Indemnitee”) of any notice of any
demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or
threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an “Asserted Liability”) that may result in a Loss, the
Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the “Claims Notice”) to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section
9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if
necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following
procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to
compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty
(30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall
cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall
make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or
appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to
Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in
42consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee
reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior
written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter
into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Indemnitee if the
terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the
indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee’s business and (z) do not include any
admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the
Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay,
compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the
indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after
providing at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only
money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party’s business and (iii) do
not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all

ARTICLE 10 - TERMS, TERMINATION, AND FORCE MAJEURE
Section 10.1 Terms. This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue unless and until
terminated as provided herein.
Section 10.2 [Reserved].
Section 10.3 [Reserved].
Section 10.4 Termination by Monsanto.
(a) Termination Rights. In addition to its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.9, Monsanto
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving the Agent a termination notice specified for each termination event upon
the occurrence and continuance of either of the following:
(1) An Event of Default occurring at any time; or
43(2) A Change of Control with respect to Monsanto or a Roundup Sale, in each case, by giving the Agent
a notice of termination, such termination to be effective at the end of the fifth (5th) full Program Year after such notice is provided.
(b) Event of Default . An Event of Default shall mean any of the following occurrences:
(1) a Material Breach of this Agreement committed by the Agent and established in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;
(2) a Material Fraud committed by the Agent and established in accordance with the provisions of Section
10.4(g) of this Agreement;
(3) Material Willful Misconduct committed by the Agent and established in accordance with the provisions
of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;
(4) [Intentionally omitted.];
(5) [Intentionally omitted.];
(6) the Insolvency of Agent;
(7) the occurrence of a Change of Control of an SMG Target without the prior written consent of
Monsanto, unless the Agent has determined in its reasonable commercial opinion that such acquiror can and will fully perform the
duties and obligations of the Agent under this Agreement;
(8) [Intentionally omitted.]; or
(9) except to the extent permitted herein, (i) the assignment of all, or substantially all, of the Agent’s rights,
or (ii) the delegation of all, or substantially all, of the Agent’s obligations hereunder, in either instance without the prior written
consent of Monsanto.
As to any Event of Default defined in Sections 10.4(b)(1)-(3), such termination shall take effect on the
later of the first business day following the thirtieth (30th) day after the sending of a termination notice to the Agent in accordance
with the provisions of Section 11.9, or the date designated by Monsanto in said termination notice. As to any Event of Default
defined in Sections 10.4(b)(6), (7) and (9), such termination shall take effect on the later of the first business day following the
seventh (7th) day after the sending of a termination notice to Agent, or the date designated by Monsanto in said notice of
termination.
(c) Payment of Termination Fee. Except for termination of this Agreement by Monsanto upon any Event of
Default, a Termination Fee (as specified in Section 10.4.(d)) shall only be paid either by Monsanto or by the successor to the
Roundup Business, as the case may be, upon the following terms and conditions:
44(1) in the event the Agreement is effectively terminated by either Monsanto or its successor or by the
Agent upon Material Breach, Material Fraud or Material Willful Misconduct by Monsanto as provided for in Section 10.5.(c);
(2) no later than the effective date of the applicable termination notice and no later than the effective date
of the termination; and
(3) only in the event the Agent does not become the successor to the Roundup Business, in which case the
Termination Fee shall not be paid but shall be credited against the purchase price as described in Section 10.4(d).
(d) Termination Fee. Monsanto and the Agent stipulate and agree that the injury which will be caused to the Agent
by the termination of this Agreement under the circumstances which shall give rise to the payment of the Termination Fee are
difficult or impossible of accurate estimation; that by establishing the Termination Fee they intend to provide for the payment of
damages and not a penalty; and that the sum stipulated for the Termination Fee is a reasonable pre-estimate of the probable loss
which will be suffered by the Agent in the event of such termination.
The Termination Fee payable shall vary in accordance with the Table hereunder:
Program Year Termination Fee
2015 Program Year and
thereafter
The greater of (i) $175MM or (ii) four (4) times an amount equal to (A) the average of the
Program EBIT for the three (3) trailing Program Years prior to the year of termination, minus
(B) the 2015 Program EBIT (excluding Europe and Australia) of $186.4MM.
For example, if the Roundup Sale occurs in 2033 (all expressed in $MM):
2015  2030 2031 2032 3 year Avg Termination Fee
$186.4 $310 $309 $314 $311 $498.4
(e) Remedies for Monsanto . Subject to Section 10.4(g), in case of termination by Monsanto upon any of the
Events of Default by the Agent specified in Section 10.4(b)(1)-(3), Monsanto shall be entitled to exercise all remedies available to
it, either at law or in equity. In the case of termination by Monsanto upon any of the Events of Default specified in Sections 10.4(b)
(6), (7) and (9), the remedies of Monsanto shall be limited to (i) termination of this Agreement and (ii) the recovery of reasonable
and customary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Monsanto in transferring the Agent’s duties hereunder to a new agent;
provided that in no case shall the amount of expenses recoverable under this provision exceed $20MM.
(f) Exclusive Remedy. The payment of a Termination Fee to the Agent under Section 10.4(c) shall be deemed to
constitute the exclusive remedy for any damages resulting out of the termination of this Agreement by Monsanto or the successor
to the Roundup Business pursuant
45to Section 10.4(c) and the Agent shall waive its right to exercise any other remedies otherwise available at law or in equity.
(g) Arbitration. In the event either party claims that a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful
Misconduct has been committed by the other party (the “Breaching Party”), or this Agreement otherwise explicitly provides that
the provisions of this Section 10.4(g) apply, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) After the asserted occurrence of a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct,
the party who contends that such breach, fraud or misconduct has occurred (the “Claimant”) shall send to the Breaching Party a
notice, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Claimant shall: (i) identify the
Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct which it contends has occurred; (ii) appoint an arbitrator; and (iii)
demand that the Breaching Party appoint an arbitrator.
(2) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice, the Breaching Party shall send a response to the
Claimant, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Breaching Party shall: (i)
indicate whether it contests the asserted occurrence of the Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the
case may be; and (ii) if it does contest such asserted occurrence, appoint a second arbitrator. The failure on the part of the
Breaching Party to timely respond to the notice, and/or to timely appoint its arbitrator, shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of
the arbitrator designated by the Claimant as the ‘sole arbitrator.
(3) If the Breaching Party appoints an arbitrator, then within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the
Breaching Party’s response by the Claimant, the two arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator. If the arbitrators selected by
the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration
Association. Upon their selection by either means, the three arbitrators (the “Arbitrators”) shall expeditiously proceed to determine
whether a Material Breach, Material Default or Material Willful Misconduct has occurred, in accordance with the procedures
hereafter set forth.
(4) Except as specifically modified herein, the arbitration proceeding contemplated by this section (the
“Arbitration”) shall be conducted in accordance with Title 9 of the US Code (United States Arbitration Act) and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The cost of the Arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, with the understanding that
the Arbitrators may reimburse the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the Arbitrators for that party’s cost of the Arbitration in
connection with the award made by the Arbitrators as described below.
(5) The award shall be made within three (3) months after the appointment of the third Arbitrator, and
each of the Arbitrators shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. However, this time limit may be
extended by agreement of the parties or by the Arbitrators, if necessary.
46(6) Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the written request of the
other party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by the notice or the response,
including those documents on which the producing party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. Any
dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the Arbitrators, which determination shall
be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed within 60 days following the appointment of the third Arbitrator.
(7) At the request of a party, the Arbitrators shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition
of witnesses to the extent the Arbitrators deem such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be held
within 30 days of the making of a request, and shall be limited to a maximum of number of hours’ duration as may be mutually
agreed to by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement as may be determined by the Arbitrators. All objections are
reserved for the arbitration hearing, except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information.
(8) Either party may apply to the Arbitrators seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered
or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any
court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the
establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal’s determination of the merits of the controversy).
(9) The scope of the Arbitration shall include the following:
(i) a determination as to whether the act(s) or omission(s) set forth by the Claimant have occurred;
(ii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred
constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection
with this Agreement, as the case may be;
(iii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred
constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be;
(iv) a determination as to the amount of monetary damages, if any, suffered by the Claimant, as a
result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct
in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, regardless of
whether such act(s) or omission(s) rise to the level of Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case
may be;
(v) a determination, to the extent applicable, of the specific performance which could and should
be decreed to correct any breach, fraud or material misconduct which the Arbitrators determine can be cured by the issuance of
such decree;
47(vi) a determination as to which party, if any, is the prevailing party in the Arbitration, and the
amount of such party’s costs and fees. “Costs and fees” means all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the
arbitrators’ fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness
fees, and attorneys’ fees; and
(vii) a determination as to such matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to carry
out their duties in connection with the Arbitration.
(10) The Arbitrators’ award shall be in writing, shall be signed by a majority of the Arbitrators, and shall
include a statement regarding the reasons for the disposition of any claim.
(11) The Arbitrators’ award shall, as applicable, include the following:
(i) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the Claimant has suffered monetary damages as
a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent
conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, a
monetary award in the amount of those damages;
(ii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the harm resulting from those act(s) or
omissions(s) determined to have occurred can be cured, in whole or in part by a decree of specific performance, such a decree of
specific performance implementing such determination as can be submitted to and made the order of a Court of competent
jurisdiction;
(iii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have
occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be, an award authorizing
the Claimant to immediately terminate this Agreement, together with damages or specific performance, if determined by the
Arbitrators to be appropriate;
(iv) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that there is a prevailing party, and that said
prevailing party should receive an award of its Costs and Fees, such award to the prevailing party; and
(v) such other matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to implement their
determinations made in the Arbitration.
(12) The written determination of the Arbitrators shall be made and delivered promptly to the parties to
the Arbitration and shall be final and conclusive upon the parties to the Arbitration.
(13) Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence,
content, or results of any Arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.
48Section 10.5 Termination by the Agent.

(1) a Material Breach of this Agreement committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;
(2) a Material Fraud committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;
(3) Material Willful Misconduct committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the

shall pay to the Agent the Termination Fee applicable pursuant to the Table set forth in Section 10.4(d).
(d) Brand Decline Event.
(i) If prior to Program Year 2023
(A) the Sell-Through Business has declined by more than twenty-five percent (25%) as
compared to the Sell-Through Business for Program Year 2014 due to legal, regulatory, governmental or non-governmental
organization actions adversely affecting the market for Roundup Products or due to diminished consumer or retailer acceptance of
Roundup Products due to anti-Monsanto or anti-glyphosate sentiment, or
(B) there has been a significant decline in the overall health and goodwill of the Roundup
brand, as measured by industry standard market research and best practices such as attitude and usage studies (provided that the
decline is not primarily due to the acts or omissions of the Agent or its Affiliates), and, in the case of (A) or (B),
(C) such declines cannot be remedied by the end of the next full Program Year,
then the Agent may provide notice to Monsanto of such alleged declines (such declines, a “Brand Decline Event”).
(ii) If Monsanto does not contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting
such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through
49arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice
from the Agent, then that Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of such notice, and thereafter the
Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent’s sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement, which termination shall be effective at the
end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers notice of termination pursuant to
this Section 10.5(d)(ii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the Additional Commission Amount (in addition to
the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional Commission Amount shall be subject to all other terms
and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Commission, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 10.5(d).
(iii) If Monsanto does contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting
such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this
Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice from the Agent, then the question of whether a Brand Decline Event
has occurred will be finally determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement, and if a Brand
Decline Event is finally determined to have occurred, then the Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the
date of such notice, and thereafter the Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent’s sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement,
which termination shall be effective at the end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent
delivers notice of termination pursuant to this Section 10.5(d)(iii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the
Additional Commission Amount (in addition to the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional

Section 10.6 Roundup Sale.
(a) Roundup Sale Procedures.
(i) Right of First Offer . If Monsanto (A) receives an unsolicited proposal with respect to a
potential Roundup Sale and responds in any manner, other than rejecting such proposal, (B) solicits or makes a formal
determination to solicit or make any proposal with respect to a potential Roundup Sale or (C) enters into an agreement relating to
the provision of information with respect to a potential Roundup Sale (each a “Roundup Sale Notice Trigger”), the Agent shall
have the rights as set forth in this Section 10.6 with respect to any such Roundup Sale and Monsanto shall promptly provide
written notice to the Agent of such Roundup Sale as set forth
51in Section 10.6(a)(ii) (a “Roundup Sale Notice”). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 10.6(a) shall apply to
any and all potential Roundup Sales.
(ii) Roundup Sale Notice . Upon the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, Monsanto
shall promptly provide a Roundup Sale Notice to the Agent along with all Roundup Offering Materials (subject to Monsanto
entering into a confidentiality agreement on commercially reasonable terms with the Agent with respect to such Roundup Offering
Materials). After the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, if Monsanto delivers any Roundup Offering Materials to a third
party that contain material deviations from the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent, Monsanto shall
provide copies of such Roundup Offering Materials to the Agent promptly after such delivery.
(iii) Exclusivity.
(A) For a period of sixty (60) days from the last date of receipt by the Agent of the
Roundup Sale Notice and any related Roundup Offering Materials as set forth in Section 10.6(a)(ii) (the “Exclusive Roundup Sale
Period”), Monsanto agrees to negotiate in good faith with the Agent on an exclusive basis with respect to any potential Roundup
Sale. If and only if Monsanto has complied with the provisions of the preceding sentence and no definitive agreement has been
entered into with the Agent or one of its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup Sale, then following the Exclusive Roundup Sale
Period, Monsanto may then make solicitations to, or otherwise negotiate with, a third party or parties with respect to a Roundup
Sale and may provide the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent to any such third party or parties in
connection with a process to pursue a Roundup Sale. In the event that Monsanto engages in a process in which it seeks bids or
proposals from more than one third party in connection with a contemplated Roundup Sale, the Agent shall be entitled to a fifteen
(15) day exclusive negotiation period following the receipt and review by Monsanto of all bids or proposals (the “Roundup Quiet
Period”), provided that, in determining the value of the price terms of the Agent’s bid, Monsanto shall not discount the Agent’s bid
as a result of the fact that the Termination Fee is an offset or credit against the total purchase price, and that, during the Roundup
Quiet Period, the Agent shall have the right to revise its original bid but shall not have the right to review the terms of any other bids
or proposals. Monsanto may consummate a Roundup Sale with any third party only if such Roundup Sale is made pursuant to the
acceptance by Monsanto of a Roundup Superior Offer.
(B) During the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period, neither Monsanto nor any of its Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly through its or their agents, employees or representatives or otherwise, solicit, or cause the solicitation of,
or in any way encourage the making of, any offer, proposal or indication of interest involving a Roundup Sale or negotiate with,
respond to any inquiry from (except for “no comment” or another statement agreed to by the Agent), cooperate with or furnish or
cause or authorize to be furnished any information to, any third party or its agents, employees or representatives with respect
thereto, or disclose to any third party that a Roundup Sale Notice has been provided to the Agent. Monsanto will immediately
advise the Agent of any offer, proposal or indication of interest received by Monsanto or its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup
Sale during the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period.
52(b) Credit of Termination Fee. In the event that the Agent or any of its Affiliates acquires the Roundup Business
in a Roundup Sale, the Termination Fee that would have been payable to the Agent upon a termination pursuant to Section 10.4(a)
(2) shall be credited against the purchase price to be paid by the Agent or such Affiliate in the Roundup Sale.
(c) Agent’s Election. In the event that Monsanto determines to consummate a Roundup Sale with a party other
than the Agent, Monsanto shall deliver the Agent notice thereof and of the identity of such other party. Within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such notice, the Agent shall deliver written notice to Monsanto stating either that:
(1) The Agent intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(b), in which case such notice
shall constitute a termination notice for purposes of this Agreement provided that the termination shall be effective at the end of the
Third Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers its Notice of Termination pursuant to this provision; or
(2) The Agent will not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(b) and agrees to continue the
performance of its obligations under the Agreement unless and until the Agent receives a termination notice delivered in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement by the successor to the Roundup Business.
(d) Successor. Upon consummation of a Roundup Sale to a party other than the Agent, Monsanto’s successor to
the Roundup L&G Business shall assume all rights and responsibilities of Monsanto under this Agreement.
(e) Noncompetition Upon Termination. In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Monsanto pursuant to
Section 10.4(a)(2) hereof, or by the Agent pursuant to Section 10.6(c)(1) hereof, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section
6.13 hereof, either party may, no earlier than three (3) years prior to the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, commence non-
commercial activities (including formulation development, regulatory registrations, packaging and delivery systems development,
and advertising and promotional material development and any other activities not prohibited by Section 6.13 of this Agreement
during the Noncompetition Period, but excluding consumer-facing efforts or communications) for the sole purpose of such party’s
preparation to launch any competing product upon expiration of the Noncompetition Period; and provided, that either party may,
no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, engage with retail customers for the sole
purpose of selling-in competing products (provided that no product may be shipped to a retail customer or distributor prior to the
end of the Noncompetition Period).
Section 10.7 Effect of Termination.
(a) Reserved.

comply with the other Party's requests as to the use of the other Party's
Trademarks and will avoid knowingly taking any action that diminishes the value
of such Trademarks.

that: (a) it has the full corporate right, power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder; (b) its performance of
this Agreement, and the other Party's exercise of such other Party's rights
under this Agreement, will not conflict with or result in a breach
                                     -15-
or violation of any of the terms or provisions or constitute a default under any
agreement by which it is bound; (c) when executed and delivered, this Agreement

defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (the "Indemnified Party")
and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors and
representatives) from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages,
judgments and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any
Claim, to the extent it is based on (a) the operation or content of the
Indemnifying Party's Site (other than any items or materials supplied, or
operation or content required, by the Indemnified Party), (b) the offer,
marketing or sale of any products or services through the Indemnifying Party's
Site (other than any products offered, marketed or sold by the Indemnified Party

Indemnifying Party as to any Claim related to any products offered, marketed or
sold by Company through the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section  and/or Mirror Company
Site, except to the extent that such Claim relates to any ACSI Site
Functionality or other items or content provided by or for ACSI with respect to
the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section  and/or Mirror Company Site), (c) any actual or
alleged breach of the Indemnifying Party's representations or warranties set
forth in Section 7.1  [Representations] above, or, in the case of Company, its obligations under
Section 4.4  [Regulatory Compliance]   above, or (d) any actual or alleged infringement of any
Intellectual Property Rights by any content, items or materials provided by the

or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by
them resulting from any such Claim.
     7.3  Procedure.  In connection with any Claim described in this Section 7,
the Indemnified Party will (a) give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice
of the Claim, (b) cooperate with the Indemnifying Party (at the Indemnifying
Party's expense) in connection with the defense and settlement of the Claim, and
(c) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the
Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party may not settle the Claim without the
Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably
withheld).  Further, the Indemnified Party (at its cost) may participate in the
defense and settlement of the Claim with counsel of its own choosing.  Unless
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within five (5)
days of its receipt of notice of any Claim that it irrevocably elects not to
assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
elected to assume the defense of such Claim.  If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to assume the defense of any Claim, or having assumed the defense of any
Claim fails to pursue diligently the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to participate in or
control the defense or settlement of such Claim and the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to sole control of the defense and settlement of such Claim (without
limitation of the Indemnifying Party's indemnity obligations under this Section
7).

a prorated portion of the Annual Fee due for the Year in which termination is

reason of ACSI's breach hereof, Company shall have no further payment
obligation, and, if such termination occurs at any time during the Refund
Source: AUDIBLE INC, 10-Q, 11/13/2000Period, ACSI shall promptly either (a) refund to Company a percentage of the

           10.5.2  [***]
           10.5.3  Construction by Court.  To the extent that any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of Section 10.5.2  [Effect of Termination]  is for
any reason unlawful, invalid, in violation of public policy or otherwise
unenforceable in whole or in part, such provision shall be narrowed in scope to
the extent necessary to make the same lawful, valid and enforceable while as
nearly as possible reflecting the intent of the Parties as expressed in this
Agreement.
           10.5.4  User Transition.  Upon any termination or expiration of the

provision of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that no failure
by the Parties to develop the Phase II Development Plan as contemplated by
Section 4.1.3  [Phase II] shall be deemed, in itself, a breach of this Agreement by either
Party (and therefore that such occurrence shall not, in itself, give rise to any
of the remedies specified in Section 10.5.1  [General] or Section 10.5.2  [Effect of Termination] ).

Section  11.  Miscellaneous
      11.1    Tax Treatment.
              11.1.1  The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are not intended to create any jurisdiction
or authority for any governmental authority to impose any obligation to collect
any sales tax, use tax or similar tax in connection with any sales of products
by either Party or its Affiliates. Accordingly, each Party agrees to take such
action as the other Party may reasonably request (including, without limitation,
execution of affidavits and other documents) to avoid or curtail the imposition,
by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, of any such
obligation on such Party or its Affiliates, or the establishment of a nexus for
tax purposes sufficient to grant any jurisdiction the authority to levy any
sales tax, use tax or similar tax on sales of products by such Party or its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 11.1.1  [Tax Treatment] shall limit Company's obligations under Section 11.1.2  [Tax Treatment].
              11.1.2  Company will collect and pay, and indemnify and hold
harmless ACSI and its Affiliates from, any sales, use, excise, import or export,

and withholding thereof and attorneys fees in connection therewith, arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement or Company's advertisement, offer or

obtain, and thereafter throughout the Term and for a period of six (6) months
thereafter maintain, such policy or policies of insurance as is commercially
reasonable for the transactions and business contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company will ensure that such
policies contain a waiver of subrogation against ACSI, name ACSI and its
assignees as additional insureds.  Company will not modify or terminate any
coverage without giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to ACSI.
Upon request from ACSI, Company will furnish to ACSI certificates of insurance
and such other documentation relating to such policies as ACSI may reasonably
request.
     11.3     Independent Contractors. The Parties are entering this Agreement
as independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed to create a
partnership, joint venture or employment relationship between them. Neither
Party will represent itself to be an employee or agent of the other or enter
into any agreement or legally binding commitment or statement on the other's
behalf of or in the other's name.
     11.4     Nondisclosure. Each Party will protect the Confidential
Information of the other Party from misappropriation and unauthorized use or
disclosure, and at a minimum, will take precautions at least as great as those
taken to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no
event with less than reasonable care. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Receiving Party will: (a) use such Confidential Information  solely for the
purposes for which it has been disclosed; and (b) disclose such Confidential
                                     -21-
Information only to those of its and its Affiliates' employees, agents, and
consultants who have a need to know the same for the purpose of performing this
Agreement and who are informed of and agree to a duty of nondisclosure. The
Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information  of the Disclosing
Party to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law or legal process or
pursuant to a registration report or exhibits thereto filed or to be filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, listing agency or any stock securities
commission, or any other associated filings, provided that the Receiving Party
uses gives the Disclosing Party not less than ten (10) days' prior written
notice thereof and complies with all reasonable requests of the Disclosing Party
to minimize the extent or scope of any such disclosure. Upon request of the
other Party, or in any event upon any termination or expiration of the Term,
each Party shall return to the other or destroy (and certify in writing such
destruction) all materials, in any medium, which contain, embody, reflect or
Source: AUDIBLE INC, 10-Q, 11/13/2000reference all or any part of any Confidential Information  of the other Party.
     11.5     Costs.  Except as expressly provided herein, each Party will be

may from time to time change such address or individual by giving the other
Party notice of such change in accordance with this Section 11.6  [Notices].
     11.7     Assignment. Company may not assign or delegate this Agreement or
any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether voluntarily, involuntarily,
by operation of Law or otherwise, without ACSI's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Company may
assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary in
connection with any corporate reorganization undertaken for the purpose of
minimizing the tax liability of Company and its Affiliates or other bona fide
corporate purpose or in connection with any Change of Control [***]. Subject to
the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and their successors and assigns. ACSI may

conditions of this Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be

     11.8     Nonwaiver.  To be effective, any waiver by a Party of any of its
rights or the other Party's obligations under this Agreement must be made in a
writing signed by the Party to be charged with the waiver.  No failure or
forbearance by either Party to insist upon or enforce performance by the other
Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise at law or in equity shall be
construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such Party's right to
assert or rely upon any such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other
instance; rather the same shall be and remain in full force and effect.
     11.9     Counterparts; Transmitted Copies. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all
of which taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. To expedite
the process of entering into this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that
Transmitted Copies of the Agreement shall be equivalent to original documents
until such time (if any) as original documents are completely executed and
delivered. "Transmitted Copies" shall mean copies which are reproduced or
transmitted via facsimile, or another process of complete and accurate
reproduction and transmission.

of or related to this Agreement and agrees not to commence or prosecute any such
claim, action or proceeding other than in the aforementioned courts.
     11.13    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (a) represents the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes any previous or contemporaneous oral or written agreements regarding
such subject matter and (b) may be amended or modified only by a written
instrument signed by a duly authorized agent of each Party.  No breach of this
Agreement by either Party shall affect the rights or obligations of either Party
under any other Agreement between the Parties; rather, the same will remain in

WHOLESALE MARKETING AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is entered into effective as of the 24 th  day of August 2018, by and among ALPS Distributors, Inc., a Colorado
corporation (the “Distributor ”) and S2K Financial LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“S2K”).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the Distributor has entered into a Distribution Agreement with each fund set forth in Exhibit A hereto, each a Delaware
statutory trust and each of which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act ”), as a closed-end
management investment company (each a “Fund” and collectively referred to as the “Funds”);
WHEREAS, the Distributor is the distributor of each Fund and enters into broker-dealer selling agreements ( “Selling Agreements”) with
respect to each such Fund;
WHEREAS, the Funds’ shares may be sold by broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “FINRA”); and
WHEREAS, the Distributor wishes to retain S2K, through registered representatives of S2K (“Authorized S2K Representatives” ), to
introduce the Funds to registered representatives of broker-dealers and registered investment advisers located at the financial institutions (each, an
“Intermediary”  and collectively, “Intermediaries ”) that may have customers interested in investing in a Fund.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter contained, the
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by the parties, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Services Provided by S2K. S2K agrees, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, through its Authorized S2K Representatives, to
use its reasonable best efforts to market the Funds to the Intermediaries, and to identify, refer and/or introduce Intermediaries to the Funds. In
connection therewith, S2K may (i) engage in seminars, conferences and media interviews for financial intermediaries; (ii) distribute sales literature
and other communications (including electronic media) regarding the Funds, subject to review and approval of such material by the Distributor; and
(iii) perform other services reasonably contemplated in writing by S2K and the Distributor.
S2K shall not act as an underwriter in connection with S2K’s wholesale activities relating to shares of the Funds where S2K receives all or
substantially all of the sales load, as set forth in each Fund’s then-current prospectus ( “Prospectus”).
S2K will market the Funds to Intermediaries that:
(a) are registered as “broker-dealers” with the SEC, FINRA, and any other applicable jurisdiction in which they operate and are
required to be so registered by law;
Source: CC REAL ESTATE INCOME FUND-ADV, POS 8C, 12/5/2018(b) will enter into a Selling Agreement agreed to by Distributor and such “broker-dealers,” or in such other form of Intermediary
agreement (which shall include, without limitation, broker/dealer Selling Agreements, platform agreements and wirehouse agreements) as required
by an Intermediary with the Distributor to sell shares of the Funds to investors (copies of which shall be made available to S2K); and
(c) will sell shares of the Funds through representatives in accordance with the then-current applicable Prospectus and in
accordance with the provisions of the Selling Agreement.
2. Services Provided by the Distributor.
(a) The Distributor will coordinate the completion and execution of Selling Agreements with broker-dealers and/or Intermediaries.
(b) Advertising and Sales Literature Review
(i) The Distributor shall provide review of broker-dealer related advertising and sales literature pieces ( “marketing pieces ”)
submitted to Distributor by S2K. Documentation (which shall include electronic correspondence) not defined as “marketing pieces,” which
shall include, but is not limited to, correspondence and materials provided directly in response to due diligence requests, shall be
principally reviewed and approved by S2K.
(ii) Distributor’s services are based on the understanding that S2K will utilize current systems and expertise owned by Distributor,
specifically the AdLit Advertising Review System (“ AdLit ”), and that Distributor will base its reviews on: (i) the guidelines contained
within Distributor’s Sales and Advertising Guide and Distributor’s Written Supervisory Procedures; (ii) rules and guidance issued by
FINRA and the SEC related to communications with the public and/or communications to institutional investors, as those terms are
defined in FINRA Rules 2210 and 2211 and in various other FINRA and SEC rules and interpretive material; and (iii) Distributor’s
submission guidelines with respect to the use of trademarked and/or copyright materials, to the extent applicable. All material submitted to
Distributor will be provided by Distributor to S2K with comments or approval no later than three business days after receipt in AdLit.
(iii) Each marketing piece submitted to Distributor for review will be subject to the following process:
a) Each piece will undergo review at Distributor by a FINRA-licensed registered principal possessing the required
expertise and appropriate license to review the marketing piece submitted to Distributor;
b) Distributor’s comments shall consist of (i) recommendations for changes that, in the opinion of the Distributor
reviewer, will be consistent with the guidelines specified by Distributor in Section 2(b)(ii) above, or (ii) in the form of an
acknowledgement that the submitted material is consistent with such guidelines with no additional changes. In the event of the
latter, the item will be approved by the registered principal and filed with the applicable regulatory body if necessary;
- 2 -
Source: CC REAL ESTATE INCOME FUND-ADV, POS 8C, 12/5/2018c) Distributor will provide system training and ongoing consulting with respect to advertising review guidelines and
rules for each marketing piece submitted via the process described herein; and
d) Distributor will make all required FINRA filings of marketing materials which have been approved by Distributor.
(iv) If S2K wishes Distributor to perform an expedited review of marketing pieces within one business day of Distributor’ receipt
of such marketing pieces, the expedited review will be performed subject to and in accordance with the following:
a) A charge of $250 will apply to each request for expedited review, in addition to FINRA filing fees.
b) The marketing piece must be 30 pages or less in actual length in order to be considered for expedited review. Web
pages and other marketing pieces over 30 pages require a more in-depth review; therefore, Distributor cannot guarantee a one
business day review for these items.
c) The marketing piece must be submitted via Distributor’s AdLit system by no later than 3:00 P.M. Mountain Time (2:00
P.M. PT/5:00 P.M. ET) on a business day in order to ensure that the Distributor has a full one business day to review and provide
S2K with comments within such one business day timeframe.
d) S2K must check the box on the AdLit coversheet whereby S2K requests and accepts the terms and fee(s) associated
with expedited review in order to ensure that Distributor is notified of the expedited request.
e) Distributor cannot guarantee that a marketing piece will be APPROVED within one business day of being received via
AdLit. Distributor will review and submit comments to S2K within this timeframe. If Distributor fails to provide S2K with
comments within one business day, the $250 expedited review charge will not apply.
3. Performance Requirements. S2K shall devote sufficient staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as shall be consistent
with industry standards for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K shall perform these services in a professional and competent manner and shall
provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to
provide such services at no cost to the Distributor.
4. Duration and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on the 60th day following a
written notice from one party to the other of its decision to terminate this Agreement at the end of such 60-day period or upon termination of the
applicable Distribution Agreement with respect to a Fund. Termination of this Agreement as to a Fund shall not terminate this Agreement with
respect to any other Fund so long as such other Fund’s (or Funds’, as the case may be) Distribution Agreement is effective. If this Agreement is
terminated by one party, it shall terminate the entire Agreement.

  -72-News Release 
EKR Therapeutics Achieves Key Growth Milestone with the  Acquisition of Rights to DepoDur®, a Novel Extended-Release Opioid  Analgesic for Post Operative Pain  
Cedar Knolls, N.J., August X, 2007 – EKR Therapeutics, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing proprietary products to enhance patient quality-of-life in the acute care setting, today announced it has acquired exclusive marketing and distribution rights to DepoDur for the Americas from San Diego-based Pacira Pharmaceuticals who retains manufacturing rights to the product.  
Formerly a business unit of SkyePharma, plc, Pacira Pharmaceuticals is an independent private company focused on developing and manufacturing controlled-release injectable products based on their DepoFoam™ and Biosphere™ drug delivery platforms.  
DepoDur, which utilizes the DepoFoam technology, is a sterile injectable suspension of multivesicular liposomes formulated to provide extended release of morphine sulfate. It is the only extended-release opioid that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for epidural use. A single injection of DepoDur into the lumbar epidural space may provide pain relief for up to 48 hours following major surgery without the restrictions and potential complications associated with an indwelling epidural catheter.  
“The product characteristics of DepoDur fit exceptionally well with EKR’s acquisition model,” said Howard Weisman, EKR’s Chairman & CEO. “DepoDur is patent protected, addresses an important medical need in our market space, and has growth prospects that can be fully exploitedthrough the application of EKR’s expertise and strengths in the acute care market.”  
Mr. Weisman further noted, “EKR is commencing a number of pre-launch activities, including interacting with opinion leaders, and we expect to fully deploy our sales force in support of DepoDur early next year.” He concluded, “We are very optimistic about EKR’s growth prospects in 2008 as we foresee a ramp up in sales for both DepoDur and Gelclair® and anticipate favorable market synergies between these products.” Gelclair, which is marketed to acute care facilities and cancer centers, is indicated for the management of pain associated with oral lesions of various etiologies, including chemotherapy and radiation induced oral mucositis/stomatitis.  
Tong Zhang, Ph.D., Director of Business Development for EKR, added, “Acquiring the rights to DepoDur exemplifies EKR’s strategy of focusing on building a portfolio of premier products in the acute care space.” He further noted, “Our strict acquisition criteria center on high-margin, innovative products that offer value to healthcare providers and their patients, thus, representing excellent opportunities for EKR to realize strong returns on investment.”

which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Remarketing Agents so material and adverse as to make it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
Final Prospectus;
(j) On or after the Remarketing Date, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a change in U.S. or international financial,

expenses reasonably incurred by such Remarketing Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses
are incurred; provided, however , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or

Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which the Company may become subject, under the
Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing

are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such
indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying
party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have
to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced by such omission. In case
any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of
the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such
subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in
connection with the defense thereof
 
26other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless ( i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the
contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or ( iii)
the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No
indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and ( ii) does not include a
statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying
party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified
parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or
circumstances.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
subsection ( a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due
to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities to which
any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and
the Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by
the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds
from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, as
set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.
 
27The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing
Agents on the other and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d)
were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall
be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the
public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing
Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities and
not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall
extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act. The
obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agent may
otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with
his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of the Act.
7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents . A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Stock
Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents;  provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the
Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor
to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a
 
28letter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to
conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal
of the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement.
8. New Remarketing Agents. The Company may appoint any institution or institutions as new Remarketing Agent(s) hereunder (each a “ New
Remarketing Agent”) in respect of the Remarketing in which event, upon the confirmation by such institution through a letter to the Company and
the Stock Purchase Contract Agent confirming acceptance of such nomination by the New Remarketing Agent substantially in the form of Annex
III hereof, such New Remarketing Agent shall become a party hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, with all the authority, rights, powers,
duties and obligations as if originally named as Remarketing Agent hereunder. The Company will notify the Remarketing Agent(s) appointed in
respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of a change in the identity of other Remarketing
Agents appointed or who have resigned in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities generally as soon as reasonably practicable.
9. Offering Restrictions. Each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed
pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree that it has not remarketed or delivered
and it will not remarket or deliver, any of the Remarketed Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably

10. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. Each Remarketing Agent, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other
capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agents may exercise any
vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like

engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.

omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however , that the Fund makes no representations or
warranties with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use in the Remarketing Materials.

MFP Shares, upon the investor’s request.
Section 4. Fees and Expenses. For the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder, the Fund shall pay
to the Remarketing Agent in arrears on the first day of each calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the next

Agent, as applicable. The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any Holder of VRRM-MFP
Shares may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Statement with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.

incorporated therein by reference) as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request from time to time; (ii) notice of the creation
of any subsidiary by the Fund; (iii) notice of the purchase of VRRM-MFP Shares by a subsidiary or affiliate of the Fund as soon
as the Fund shall become aware of such purchase; (iv) notice of any change (including being put on Credit Watch or Watchlist),
suspension or termination in or of the ratings on the VRRM-MFP Shares by any NRSRO then rating the VRRM-MFP Shares or
any change of an NRSRO rating the VRRM-MFP Shares as promptly as practicable upon the occurrence thereof or the
occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of Section 8 hereof (with the occurrence of any of the events
described in clause (b)(ii) to be determined without regard to the opinion of the Remarketing Agent referred to therein); and (v) in
connection with a remarketing, a Remarketing Memorandum, and such other remarketing information, as the Remarketing Agent
may reasonably request from time to time, including but not limited to the financial condition of the Fund. The Fund agrees to
provide the Remarketing Agent with as many copies of the foregoing materials and information as the Remarketing Agent may
reasonably request for use in connection with a remarketing or Transition Remarketing, as the case may be, of VRRM-MFP
Shares and consents to the use thereof for such purpose.
(b) If at any time during the term of this Agreement any event or condition known to the Fund relating to or affecting the
Fund or the VRRM-MFP Shares shall occur which might affect the accuracy or completeness of any statement of a material fact
contained in any of the reports, documents, materials and information referred to in clause (a)(v) above or any document
incorporated therein by reference (collectively, the “Remarketing Materials”) or any other materials or information made
publicly available by the Fund, the Fund shall promptly notify the Remarketing Agent in writing of the circumstances and details of
such event or condition and the Fund shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the Remarketing Agent, at
the Fund’s expense, a supplement or amendment to the Remarketing Materials describing the circumstances and details of such
event or condition.
8Section 8. Conditions to Obligations of the Remarketing Agent. The obligations of the Remarketing Agent with respect to
VRRM-MFP Shares under this Agreement have been undertaken in reliance on, and shall be subject to: (a) the due performance
in all material respects by the Fund of its obligations and agreements as set forth in this Agreement (including Sections 3(c) and
7(b) hereof); and (b) the non-occurrence of any of the following events: (i) all of the VRRM-MFP Shares shall have been
redeemed by the Fund; (ii) without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, the Supplement, the Statement, the
Declaration, the by-laws of the Fund, or the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement shall either not be in full force and effect or have
been amended in any manner that in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially changes the nature of the VRRM-
MFP Shares or the remarketing procedures; (iii) legislation, or a decision by a court of the United States shall be rendered, or a
stop order, ruling, regulation or official statement by, or on behalf of, the Commission or other governmental agency having
jurisdiction of the subject matter shall be made, to the effect that the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares is or would be in
violation of any provision of the 1933 Act as then in effect, or the 1934 Act as then in effect, or with the purpose or effect of
otherwise prohibiting the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares, as contemplated hereby, without registration under the 1933
Act; (iv) any legislation, resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation shall be enacted by, any governmental body, department or agency
of the United States or the State of New York, or a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction within the United States or the
State of New York shall be rendered, which, in the Remarketing Agent’s reasonable opinion, materially adversely affects the
marketability of the VRRM-MFP Shares; (v) additional material restrictions not in force as of the date hereof shall have been
imposed upon trading in securities generally by any governmental authority or by any national securities exchange, which, in the
Remarketing Agent’s reasonable opinion, would cause the performance of the Remarketing Agent’s obligations hereunder to
violate applicable law; (vi) any litigation shall be instituted and be outstanding, to restrain or enjoin the sale or remarketing of the
VRRM-MFP Shares or in any way protesting or affecting any authority of the Fund with respect to the validity of the VRRM-
MFP Shares or this Agreement, or the existence or powers of the Fund to perform its obligations hereunder; (vii) a general
banking moratorium has been declared by federal or New York authorities having jurisdiction, a material disruption in commercial
banking or securities settlement or clearance services or a force majeure event shall have occurred which in the reasonable opinion
of the Remarketing Agent materially adversely affects the settlement or clearance of the VRRM-MFP Shares; or (viii) a material
misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials has occurred, so that it is not advisable, in the reasonable judgment of the
Remarketing Agent, to attempt to remarket the VRRM-MFP Shares, provided that the Remarketing Agent, upon identifying any
such material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials, shall promptly notify the Fund. In the event of the failure of
any such conditions with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares, the Remarketing Agent may terminate its obligations under this
Agreement with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares as provided in Section 10(b).
Section 9. Indemnification.
(a) The Fund and the Investment Adviser, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing
Agent and its respective officers, directors, employees and control persons within the meaning of the 1934 Act (collectively, the
“Indemnified Persons”
9and individually, an “Indemnified Person”) from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any Indemnified
Person may become subject insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, or are
based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the Remarketing Materials or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent
specifically for use therein), or arise out of, or are based upon, any violation by the Fund or the Investment Adviser of, or any
failure by the Fund or the Investment Adviser to perform, any of its obligations under, this Agreement. The Fund and the
Investment Adviser agree to promptly reimburse each Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Indemnified Person in investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim; provided, however, that
neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
liability arises out of the use by the Remarketing Agent of any information that is not contained in the Remarketing Materials (in the
form provided for use in connection with the remarketing). The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any
liability or obligation which the Fund or the Investment Adviser may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person and shall extend
upon the same terms and conditions to each Person, if any, who controls any Indemnified Person within the meaning of the 1934
Act.
(b) The Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against every loss, liability or
expense, including without limitation, damages, fines, suits, actions, demands, costs, out-of-pocket expenses, and reasonable legal
fees and expenses (collectively, “Losses ”), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for
or in respect of its (1) execution and delivery of this Agreement, (2) compliance or attempted compliance with or reliance upon any
instruction or other direction upon which the Remarketing Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
(3) performance under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Loss resulted from such Indemnified Person’s gross
negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, violations of law or violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses
that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of the failure of the Remarketing
Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a remarketing, if such failure is due to the failure by the Fund to
provide to the Remarketing Agent such Remarketing Materials for delivery (regardless of whether the Remarketing Agent has
requested such Remarketing Materials), notwithstanding that such failure by the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing
Materials during the course of a Remarketing could be deemed a violation of law by an Indemnified Person. The indemnity
agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund may otherwise have to any Indemnified
Person.
(c) Each Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each of the Fund and the
Investment Adviser (collectively, the “Indemnifying Persons” and individually, an “Indemnifying Person”) of any action
commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons
10shall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity
agreement. No settlement or compromise of any such action shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Persons, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(d) In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Person, and it notifies each Indemnifying Person from
which it seeks indemnification of the commencement thereof, such Indemnifying Person (which may be the Fund and/or the
Investment Adviser, in the case of notification of either) will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly
with any other Indemnifying Person, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof so long as its interests are not adverse to those
of the Indemnified Person, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and after notice from each
Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person will not be
liable to such Indemnified Person under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Upon assumption by any Indemnifying
Person of the defense of any such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such action or
proceeding and to retain its own counsel but the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any legal expenses of other counsel
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnifying Person has
agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Person in a timely manner, or (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual
or potential conflicting interests between the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified Person, including situations in which there
are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to each of
the Fund and the Investment Adviser. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to assume the defense of any such suit, it will reimburse
the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. In the event that the parties to any
such action (including impleaded parties) include one or more Indemnifying Persons and one or more Indemnified Persons, and
one or more Indemnified Persons shall have been advised by counsel reasonably satisfactory to each Indemnifying Person that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to any of the Indemnified Persons, which are different from, additional to, or in
conflict with those available to any of the Indemnifying Persons, the Indemnifying Persons will reimburse the Indemnified Persons
for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the Indemnified Persons (it being understood that the Indemnifying
Persons shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of
the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys (plus local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, which firm shall be designated by the Indemnified Persons, the
Remarketing Agent or each Indemnifying Person, as the case may be). Each Indemnifying Person agrees promptly to notify each
Indemnified Person of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against it in connection with the remarketing of the
VRRM-MFP Shares. No Indemnifying Person shall consent to the terms of any compromise or settlement of any action defended
by any Indemnifying Person in accordance with the foregoing without the prior consent of the Indemnified Person. No Indemnifying
Person shall be liable under this Section 9 for the amount of any compromise or settlement of any action
11unless such compromise or settlement has been approved in writing by such Indemnifying Person, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in subparagraph (a) of this Section 9 is unavailable, because of limitations imposed
by securities laws or for any other reason, to a party that would otherwise have been an Indemnified Person under subparagraph
(a) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the party
that would have been an Indemnifying Person thereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person, contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) in such proportion so that the Remarketing Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the
Remarketing Agent’s fee (calculated for a one year period) with respect to such remarketing bears to the aggregate liquidation
preference of such VRRM-MFP Shares being remarketed but will not exceed the amount of such fee (calculated for a one year
period) and each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act. The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereon
referred to above in this subparagraph (e)) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claims (which shall be limited as provided in
this subparagraph (e) above if the Indemnifying Person has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the
provisions thereof).
(f) The indemnity agreements contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 9 shall remain operative and in full force
and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent, and shall survive the termination or
cancellation of this Agreement and the remarketing of any VRRM-MFP Shares hereunder.
Section 10. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall terminate as to the Remarketing Agent and
its obligations hereunder with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares upon the earliest to occur of (a) the effective date of the resignation
or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 5(a) and Section 5(b), respectively, (b) the completion of a successful
Transition Remarketing on a New Mode Commencement Date in connection with transition to a new Mode, or (c) the date on
which no VRRM-MFP Shares are Outstanding.
(b) In addition, the Remarketing Agent may terminate this Agreement and all of its obligations hereunder with
respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, by notifying the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent of its election to do so, if any of
the conditions referred to or set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares have not been met or satisfied in
full and such failure shall have continued for a period of 30 days after the Remarketing Agent has given notice thereof to the Fund
specifying the condition which has not been met and requiring it to be met; provided, however, that termination of this Agreement
with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by the Remarketing Agent after giving the required notices with respect to the VRRM-
MFP Shares shall be immediate in the event of the occurrence and continuation of
12any event set forth in Section 8(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, or in the event the
Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it shall not have received all of the information, whether or not specifically
referenced herein, necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares.
Section 11. Remarketing Agent’s Performance; Duty of Care.
(a) The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement and the Supplement. No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement, or the Supplement. In the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document
furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement and the Statement, as to the truth of the
statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or
communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing
Agent shall incur no liability to the Fund, the Investment Adviser, the Calculation and Paying Agent or to any Beneficial Owner (or
its Agent Member) or any Holder of the VRRM-MFP Shares in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or
failure to act, in connection with its duties under this Agreement and the Supplement or otherwise, except as a result of bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part.
(b) The Remarketing Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement arising out or caused by the failure of any other party (other than an affiliate of the Remarketing Agent) to
provide any notice, statement or document required to be delivered pursuant to any Related Document in connection with
performance by the Remarketing Agent of the relevant obligation.
Section 12. Amendment, Supplement or Modification of Agreements. Without the prior written consent of the
Remarketing Agent, the Fund will not agree or consent to any amendment, supplement or modification of the Tender and Paying
Agent Agreement, this Agreement or the Supplement, nor waive any provision thereof, if such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver would materially adversely affect the interests of the Remarketing Agent, in the Remarketing Agent’s sole
discretion; provided, that, for purposes of this Section 12, any changes or amendments to the rating agency criteria provided in the
Supplement for the VRRM-MFP Shares shall not be deemed to materially adversely affect the interests of the Remarketing Agent.
Section 13. Books and Records . The Remarketing Agent shall keep such books and records with respect to the
performance of its duties hereunder as shall be consistent with prudent industry practice and shall, to the extent permitted by law,
make such books and records available for inspection by the Fund on reasonable notice during normal business hours. Any costs
and expenses associated with such inspections shall be for the account of the party requesting such inspection.
Section 14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State
of New York, except Section 25 below, which shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
13in each case without regard to conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.
THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY SUBMIT TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL
AND NEW YORK STATE COURTS LOCATED IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
DISPUTE RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
Section 15. Waiver of Jury Trial. The Fund, the Investment Adviser and the Remarketing Agent hereby waive trial by jury
in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by any of the parties hereto against the other on any matters whatsoever arising
out of or in any way connected with this Agreement.
Section 16. Certain Provisions to Survive Termination of Agreement. Regardless of any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the obligations of the Fund and the Investment Adviser pursuant to Sections 3, 4 and 9 hereof and
of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 9 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect until fully satisfied.
Section 17. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of the Fund and the Investment Adviser hereunder may
not be assigned or delegated to any other person without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent. The rights and
obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other person without the prior written
consent of the Fund. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Fund, the Investment Adviser and the
Remarketing Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and, subject to Section 23, will not confer any benefit
upon any other person, partnership, association or corporation other than persons, if any, controlling any Remarketing Agent within
the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, or any Indemnified Person to the extent provided in
Section 9 hereof. As used in this Section 17, the terms “successors” and “assigns” shall not include any purchaser of VRRM-MFP
Shares merely because of such purchase.
Section 18. Headings. The section headings herein are for convenience of reference only, and it is agreed that such
section headings are not a part of this Agreement and will not be used in the interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement.
Section 19. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be or shall, in fact, be invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any particular case in any or all jurisdiction or jurisdictions, because it conflicts with any
provision of any constitution, statute, rule of public policy, or for any other reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of
rendering the provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or of
rendering any other provision or provisions of this Agreement invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.
Section 20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be regarded as
an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same document.
14Section 21. Remarketing Agent Not Acting as Underwriter. It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the
only obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder are as set forth in Sections 2, 3, 9 and 13 hereof. When engaged in
remarketing any properly-Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares, the Remarketing Agent shall act only as agent for and on behalf of each
owner of the VRRM-MFP Shares so tendered. The Remarketing Agent shall not act as an underwriter for the Tendered VRRM-
MFP Shares and shall in no way be obligated to advance its own funds to purchase any Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares (except as
provided in Section 2(c) or to the extent that in its individual capacity as purchaser of those VRRM-MFP Shares it may elect, in
accordance with Section 6 hereof, to purchase, in its sole discretion) or to otherwise expend or risk its own funds or incur or
become exposed to financial liability in the performance of its duties hereunder.
Section 22. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by any instrument in writing signed by all of the parties hereto
so long as this Agreement as amended is not inconsistent with the Supplement in effect as of the date of any such amendment. The
parties acknowledge that amendments to this Agreement (including with respect to Section 2(c)) are subject to prior notice
requirements as set forth in the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement.
Section 23. Benefits. Nothing herein, express of implied, shall give to any person, other than the Fund, the Remarketing
Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any benefit of any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Holder or Beneficial Owner (or their Agent Member) of VRRM-MFP Shares
shall have or be deemed to have any right in respect of, or shall in any event be entitled to enforce or to seek recourse against any
person in respect of, any provision of this Agreement, and any and all rights of holders of VRRM-MFP Shares or obligations of
the Fund in respect thereof arise only under and as governed solely by the Declaration, the Supplement and by-laws of the Fund as
they are in effect from time to time.

proceeding filed or commenced against the Fund by a Person other than the Remarketing Agent, or (z) with respect to its rights or

PRODUCT SALES
2.1 Loop Sales Contracts . As between the Parties, subject to Section 2.7, Loop shall have the sole and exclusive right to
enter into agreements for the sale of Loop-branded Products or any Products produced using Licensed Subject Matter, and the
exclusive right to set the price and quantity to be supplied under each Loop Sales Contract and other terms and conditions as
determined by Loop in its commercially reasonable discretion.
[***] Confidential treatment has been requested for the bracketed portions. The confidential redacted portion has been omitted
and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
-3-2.2 Proposed Contracts and Proposed Contract Notice . Loop shall give Joint Venture Company prompt written notice, in
the form of Exhibit A attached to this Agreement, [***] and (b) pursuant to which Loop offers to assign all of its rights and
obligations under such Loop Sales Contract to Joint Venture Company (each such notice, a “ Proposed Contract Notice ”). Along
with each Proposed Contract Notice, Loop shall deliver to Joint Venture Company a complete copy of the executed Loop Sales
Contract (the “ Proposed Contract ”). The Proposed Contract Notice shall contain information necessary to establish whether the
Proposed Contract meets the criteria set forth in the Contract Eligibility Framework. Each such Proposed Contract that (i) meets
the criteria set forth in the Contract Eligibility Framework and (ii) contains no other terms or conditions other than those set forth
in the Contract Eligibility Framework or any form of Loop Sales Contract mutually agreed in writing to be acceptable by the
Parties, shall be an “ Eligible Contract.” Each such Proposed Contract that does not qualify as an Eligible Contract shall be a
“Considered Contract .”
2.3 Acceptance of Proposed Contracts . All Eligible Contracts shall be deemed accepted by the Joint Venture Company
and become a Transferred Contract on the date Loop delivers the Proposed Contract Notice for such Eligible Contract to the Joint
Venture Company. In the event that the Proposed Contract Notice is a Considered Contract, the Joint Venture Company will have
the right to review and determine whether to accept or reject the Considered Contract within ten (10) days following Joint Venture
Company’s receipt of the Proposed Contract Notice (the “ Review Period”). Joint Venture Company shall provide Loop with a
written acceptance or rejection of each Considered Contract (“ Acceptance Notice ” or “ Rejection Notice,” as applicable) within
the Review Period, which acceptance or rejection shall be in Joint Venture Company’s sole discretion. If Joint Venture Company
does not provide an Acceptance Notice or Rejection Notice to Loop within the Review Period, the Considered Contract will be
deemed rejected by Joint Venture Company. Loop shall be entitled to present any rejected Considered Contract (whether deemed
rejected or by receipt of a Rejection Notice) to an Alternate Producer on the same terms and conditions as those presented to
Joint Venture Company. If Joint Venture Company provides an Acceptance Notice to Loop with respect to a Considered Contract
during the Review Period, that Considered Contract shall become a Transferred Contract on the date Joint Venture Company
provides that Acceptance Notice.
2.4 Assignment of Transferred Contracts . Promptly after the date a Proposed Contract becomes a Transferred Contract
(the “Assignment Date ”), Loop and Joint Venture Company shall execute and deliver an assignment and assumption agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached to this Agreement (“ Assignment ”) pursuant to which Loop shall assign to Joint
Venture Company all of Loop’s right, title, and interest in the Transferred Contract and Joint Venture Company shall assume all
such rights and obligations. Without diminishing Joint Venture Company’s obligations to perform under a Transferred Contract
pursuant to the assignment and assumption agreement, Joint Venture Company shall cause any applicable SPV to perform all of
its assumed obligations under such Transferred Contract.
2.5 Customer Interface . Joint Venture Company shall fulfill all sales of Products under all Transferred Contracts, shall
invoice Authorized Customers for all sales of Products under all Transferred Contracts, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect the amounts due under such invoices. At Joint Venture Company’s request from time to time, Loop shall provide
reasonable assistance to Joint Venture Company in such invoicing and collection process at Joint Venture Company’s expense.

indirectly, market or sell any Loop-branded Products or any Products produced using Licensed Subject Matter to any person or
entity except to Authorized Customers pursuant to a Transferred Contract (the “ Marketing and Sale Restriction ”); provided  that if
at any time during the term of this Agreement, Loop has delivered Proposed Contract Notices that result in Transferred Contracts
having binding purchase and supply obligations for less than [***] of the then existing actual production capacity of a Licensed
Facility (taking into account Joint Venture Company’s reasonable forecasts based on customer requirements, seasonal variations,
and other factors) in the subsequent three months (the “[***]”), Joint Venture Company may market and solicit orders for
Licensed Products produced in such Licensed Facility directly to customers and potential customers and enter into supply
contracts for the sale of Loop-branded Products or any Products produced using Licensed Subject Matter produced in such
Licensed Facility with customers without being restricted by the Marketing and Sale Restriction. If at any subsequent time during
the term of this Agreement Loop gives Joint Venture Party written notice that Loop is then capable of meeting, and is prepared to
meet, the [***] and provides reasonable supporting information and documentation to Joint Venture Party with such notice, then
at a date selected by Joint Venture Company that is within ninety (90) days after Joint Venture Company receives such written
notice, the Market and Sale Restriction and the other provisions of this Section 2.7 shall go back into force. Nothing in this
Section 2.7 shall relieve Loop of any of its obligations under this Agreement.
ARTICLE 3
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
3.1 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, STATUTORY, OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. JOINT VENTURE COMPANY’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY TO THE LOOP PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO A TRANSFERRED CONTRACT, IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF RECOVERY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL, DIRECT, AND
DOCUMENTED DAMAGES THE APPLICABLE AUTHORIZED CUSTOMER ACTUALLY RECOVERS FROM THE LOOP
PARTIES UNDER THE TRANSFERRED CONTRACT BASED SOLELY ON JOINT VENTURE COMPANY’S BREACH OF SUCH
TRANSFERRED CONTRACT. JOINT VENTURE COMPANY SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOOP PARTY WITH

SECTION 2.3. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH
IN THIS SECTION 3.1 SHALL BE AVAILABLE TO EITHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH OF SECTION 4,

be amended from time to time in writing by the Parties in accordance with Section 4.1 below.
1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, on a pro-rata basis, in three or more tranches (each a “Tranche”)
commencing not earlier than six (6) months after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed as soon as practicable
after the Effective Date.
- 2 -1.3 [Reserved].
1.4 The Seller Trusts and GWG intend to retain one or more nationally recognized bulge bracket investment banks (the “Bank”) for the
orderly marketing and resale of Shares pursuant to a separate engagement letter (the “Engagement Letter”) to advise them in connection with the
sale of the Tranches (together, the “Offerings”). Such Engagement Letter shall include customary representations, warranties, covenants and
indemnification provisions. The services to be performed by the Bank shall be set forth in such Engagement Letter and are expected to include,
among others:
(a) assisting in the drafting and preparation of one or more prospectus supplements describing GWG, the Shares and the terms of
the Offerings;
(b) advising the Seller Trusts on a marketing and distribution strategy for each Tranche of Shares, including whether a particular

engagement will involve the execution of a standard form agreement with respect to the distribution of each Tranche, which may be in the form of a
placement agency agreement, underwriting agreement or other appropriate agreement (each, a “Distribution Agreement”); provided, however, that
nothing contained in this OMA or Engagement Letter shall require the Bank to underwrite or purchase all or any portion of a Tranche of Stock for
its own account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Bank or its affiliates may, solely at its discretion and without
any obligation to do so, purchase Stock in any Tranche as principal.

the Bank, which fees and commissions shall be the responsibility of certain affiliates of the Seller Trusts as set forth in the applicable Distribution
Agreement; and (ii) each of GWG and the Seller Trusts shall agree to provide a customary indemnity in favor of the Bank and its affiliates.
1.7 If, in connection with the marketing, sale and distribution of a Tranche, the Bank determines that the number of Shares of Stock
proposed to be included in the Tranche exceeds the number that can reasonably be sold, then the number of Shares of Stock shall be reduced
accordingly on a pro-rata basis with respect to each of the Seller Trusts.
1.8 Prior to the offering of each Tranche, GWG shall provide the placement agents or underwriters in such Offering a list of the top 100
institutional holders of the Common Stock. In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts shall instruct the placement agents or underwriters to
use their reasonable best efforts to (i) effect as wide a distribution of the Shares as is reasonably practicable without adversely affecting the pricing
thereof and (ii) not sell any Shares to any person or Group (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”)) who, upon completion of the Offering, would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) of shares of Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5.0% or more the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (or
in the case of a person of the type described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 10% or more of the Total Voting Power).
Section 2. Compensation.
The Engagement Letter shall provide that the Bank shall not be entitled to any compensation for its advice hereunder or reimbursement of

continue this OMA and to seek to appoint a substitute investment bank, in which case GWG, after consultation with the Trust Advisors,

MANUFACTURING, DESIGN AND MARKETING AGREEMENT
This MANUFACTURING, DESIGN AND MARKETING AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into by and
between Zounds Hearing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Subcontractor”) and InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc., a Nevada
corporation, (the “Manufacturer”) Manufacturer dated effective October 3, 2018 (the “Effective Date”). Subcontractor and
Manufacturer may also be referred to herein individually as “Party” or collectively as the “Parties”.
RECITALS
WHEREAS, Subcontractor currently is the registered manufacturer of hearing aids and related components and
accessories (the “Zounds Products”) that are sold under the Subcontractor’s brand names through various marketing and
distribution channels.
WHEREAS the Parties desire to enter an agreement whereby the Subcontractor as the Manufacturer’s subcontractor will
provide design, technology, manufacturing and supply chain services to the Manufacturer to enable the Manufacturer to
manufacture comparable hearing aids and related components and accessories to be sold under Manufacturer’s exclusive brand
names (the “Manufacturer’s Products”) through the Manufacturer’s various marketing and distribution channels.
WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into a lease agreement of Subcontractor’s current Chandler, Arizona facility
that provides the Manufacturer an FDA medical device facility for the Manufacturer’s Products.
WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into an agreement that provides for the joint marketing and sale of each
other’s products.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Term. Subject to earlier termination as provided in this Agreement, the initial term of this Agreement shall be for a
period beginning on the Effective Date and ending ten (10) years thereafter unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided
herein. This Agreement will renew automatically thereafter for successive one-year terms unless and until one Party gives
notification of termination with at least sixty (60) days written notice. All orders placed under this Agreement must be placed prior
to the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
2. Technology Access Fee. Manufacturer will pay Subcontractor One Million and No/100 USD ($1,000,000) (the
“Technology Access Fee”). The Technology Access Fee will be paid in two equal installments of $500,000 each. The first
installment will be due thirty (30) days following the Effective Date and the second installment will be due sixty (60) days following
the Effective Date.
3. Orders for Manufacturer’s Products to be Manufactured by Subcontractor
3.1 Purchase Orders: Excess Inventory. Manufacturer shall provide to Subcontractor a purchase order setting
forth the proposed quantity of Manufacturer’s Products to be purchased by Manufacturer and delivery dates, which purchase
order will be subject to written acceptance by Subcontractor. All purchase orders are non-cancellable, and the Manufacturer shall
pay for the purchaser orders as follows: (i) for purchase orders for less than or equal to a total of five hundred (500) units in any
given calendar month, payment of fifty percent (50%) of Product Cost (as defined below) shall be made in full at the time the order
is placed and the remaining balance paid in full before the Manufacturer’s Products are shipped; and (ii) for purchase orders for
more than five hundred (500) units in any given calendar month, payment of one hundred percent (100%) of Product Cost shall be
made in full at the time the order is placed. Manufacturer's purchase orders accepted by Subcontractor and any forecast provided
to Subcontractor by Manufacturer will constitute authorization for Subcontractor to procure product components to manufacture
the Manufacturer’s Products covered by such purchase orders based on their lead times. Subcontractor will advise Manufacturer
of the lead time of components contained within their order and any forecast and Manufacturer will pay for the components prior
to the Subcontractor placing orders for the components.
3.2 Contract Formation: Acceptance and Entire Agreement. Each time Manufacturer submits an order for
Manufacturer’s Products and Subcontractor accepts the order or ships the ordered Manufacturer’s Products to Manufacturer, a
new contract is formed consisting of this Agreement, the quantities and delivery dates specified in the order and the prices then
offered by Subcontractor. ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S ORDER IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE TERMS
AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT MADE
BY MANUFACTURER, AND DOES NOT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF
MANUFACTURER'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
NO TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ANY PURCHASE ORDER FORM, WHETHER PROVIDED BY
MANUFACTURER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, WILL BECOME A PART OF THE CONTRACT AND THIS CONTRACT
WILL GOVERN ALL PURCHASES. Manufacturer's acceptance of or payment for Manufacturer’s Products that Manufacturer
has not ordered creates a contract comprised of this Agreement, the quantities of Manufacturer’s Products accepted or paid for,
and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement with respect to any contract
formed and shall not be altered, amended, supplemented or canceled without the express written agreement of both Manufacturer
and Subcontractor.3.3 Product Prices. Pricing shall be the actual cost of the manufacturing of each Manufacturer’s Product plus the
proportional allocation of the costs of Subcontractor’s manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain overhead, as mutually agreed
by the Parties (the “Product Cost”). Title of the product will transfer to the Manufacturer at the shipping dock of the manufacturing
facility. Manufacturer will be responsible for shipping costs. Manufacturer shall pay any taxes incurred in the manufacture of
Manufacturer’s Products, including any taxes incurred as a result of purchasing components or maintaining inventory. In addition to
the Royalties paid under this Agreement to the Subcontractor, Manufacturer shall pay any other third-party royalties for technology
that are required to manufacture the Manufacturer’s Products for their intended purpose. As of the date of this Agreement neither
Party is aware of any third-party royalties for technology that Manufacturer would be liable to pay. Subcontractor will provide
Manufacturer with documentation substantiating any Product Cost variance upon request.
3.4 Cost Reductions.  Potential Product Cost reductions as a result of materials pricing will be reviewed and
implemented periodically as mutually agreed and passed on to the Manufacturer. Product Cost reductions resulting from
engineering changes or other changes, initiated by Manufacturer, that would impact either Product Costs or process changes at
Subcontractor will be implemented at an agreed upon time. Manufacturer will be responsible for their proportionate share of any
Product Cost reduction that is a result of engineering investment by the Subcontractor. If the Manufacturer does not pay its
proportionate share, the Manufacturer will pay the Product Cost as if the cost reduction had not been made (i.e., the Product Cost
prior to the cost reduction as if the cost reduction were not made). The Subcontractor will list the new Product Cost and a line
item for engineering investment that accounts for the difference.
3.5 Royalties. In addition to paying the Product Costs of Manufacturer’s Products, Manufacturer shall also pay
to Subcontractor the following royalty payments (each a “Royalty” and collectively the “Royalties”) for each of Manufacturer’s
Product purchased under this Agreement. Royalties shall be paid 50% at time of shipping and the remaining balance of 50% due in
15-days after the Manufacturer’s Products have shipped from the manufacturing facility.
a) Non-Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer’s Products that are non-rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay
Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) eighty percent (80.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $80 per unit.
b) Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer’s Products that are rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor
a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) one hundred percent (100.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $100 per unit.
3.6 Zounds’ Products and Manufacturers Products Built to Manufacturer's Specifications. Subject to
Section 7 below, Subcontractor agrees to manufacture Manufacturer’s Products (i) that are identical to Zounds’ Products allowing
Manufacturer to utilize Subcontractor’s existing product designs and features and/ or (ii) to specifications provided by
Manufacturer from time to time with approval of such changes by Subcontractor. Any advice given by Subcontractor to
Manufacturer before or after delivery of Products built to Manufacturer's specifications is based solely upon the information
available to Subcontractor, and the use of such advice by Manufacturer is solely and entirely at Manufacturer's own risk.
Manufacturer represents and warrants that it has independently determined the fitness, need, usefulness, and applicability of the
Manufacturer’s Products built to Manufacturer's specifications it has ordered and does not rely on any representation of
Subcontractor in that regard.
3.7 Engineering Services and Design Changes.  Manufacturer may elect to utilize Subcontractor’s design
engineering resources (the “Engineering and Design Services”) to further customize Manufacturer’s Products. The cost of
Engineering and Design Services to be paid by Manufacturer will be agreed to in a written document setting forth the scope, timing
and other terms of such Engineering and Design Services executed by the Parties prior to any services being provided by
Subcontractor. Subject to the written agreement of the parties with respect to any resulting change in price, delivery schedule and
other terms, Subcontractor will accept design changes (i.e., Engineering Change Orders or "ECO's") according to Manufacturer's
instructions.
3.8 Tooling, Setup and Non-Recurring Engineering ("NRE") Charges. Subcontractor agrees to provide
Manufacturer with a quote for any one-time tooling, setup or NRE charges payable by Manufacturer as a result of a change in
design requested by Manufacturer, change in minimum quantity requirements by Manufacturer as originally quoted by
Subcontractor, or an addition to the Manufacturer’s Products purchased under this Agreement requested by Manufacturer. If
Manufacturer elects to proceed with the design change, minimum quantity requirements change or addition as specified in
Subcontractor's quote, Manufacturer will provide Subcontractor with written acceptance of Subcontractor's quoted terms.
3.9 Inventory Reports. Subcontractor agrees to report its inventory position to Manufacturer on a monthly basis,
including the following information: quantity of raw material, work in process and any open orders that cannot be cancelled to the
supplier lead time. The report will specifically identify any material on hand or on order where the quantity exceeds the agreed
three (3) month forward looking forecast plus safety stock as agreed upon by Subcontractor and Manufacturer. The
Subcontractor and Manufacturer will review inventory levels and safety stocks quarterly.
4. Delivery and Shipping. The agreed upon delivery dates are based on the Subcontractor's projected lead time, current
inventory, commitments and Subcontractor’s advice. Manufacturer agrees and acknowledges that all shipment dates are firm
delivery dates. All shipments shall be F.O.B. the manufacturing facility unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The
method and route of shipment shall be at Subcontractor's discretion, unless Manufacturer supplies instructions in writing at least
five days prior to shipment. In addition to the purchase price, Manufacturer shall pay any and all transportation charges (including
insurance). The risk of loss of and title to the Manufacturer’s Products pass to Manufacturer upon the receipt of the
Manufacturer’s Products by the carrier. Subcontractor is not responsible for any installation of Manufacturer’s Products soldhereunder or delays caused by Manufacturer-specified suppliers.
5. Leased Space Agreement.  Manufacturer will lease from Subcontractor a well-defined space for Manufacturer’s
Products within the Subcontractor’s current FDA registered manufacturer’s facility. Subcontractor is solely responsible for
maintaining all aspects of such leased space including but not limited to; (i) segregation of Manufacturer’s Products with all
Manufacturer’s Products clearly segregated and marked; and (ii) meeting all necessary requirements deemed appropriate by the
FDA and any regulatory authorities for a medical device manufacturer’s facility. Subcontractor will be also solely responsible for
remaining in good standings at all times with all regulatory authorities including but not limited to the standards set forth by the FDA
for medical device manufacturing facilities. The Manufacturer may list the address of the Subcontractor’s current FDA registered
manufacturer’s facility as the Manufacturer’s own FDA approved manufacturer’s facility for the Manufacturer’s Products. The
terms of such lease agreement will be mutually agreed to by the Parties in a separate document.
6. Payment Terms. Upon Subcontractor’s approval and acceptance of a production forecast provided by Manufacturer,
Manufacturer’s payment for Manufacturer’s Products will be due when forecasted materials or components must be ordered by
the Subcontractor as set forth in Section 3 above. A schedule of the forecast payables will be provided by the Subcontractor to
the Manufacturer based on the approved forecast. Components and products will only be procured and/or manufactured once
payment has been received. All payments will be made by electronic wire transfer and all of the appropriate forms will need to be
signed so that this can happen efficiently. Alternately, payments can be made to Subcontractor's address as shown Subcontractor's
invoice. No offsets are allowed to be taken by either Party. Manufacturer represents that all sales to Manufacturer under this
Agreement are sales for use in production or resale; therefore no sales, use, excise or other taxes are due as a result of such sales
and Manufacturer will be responsible for payment of any such taxes. A copy of the Manufacturer’s resale certificate will be
provided by Manufacturer within 15-days of the Effective Date.
7. Limited Warranty; Nonconforming Products. Since Manufacturer is paying the actual manufacturing cost of the
product, Supplier has not reserved for any warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for
any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer’s Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the
manufacturing process, Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the suppliers. Subcontractor will
provide support to Manufacturer to train Manufacturer’s employees to repair the non-conforming products as appropriate. Upon
Manufacturer’s request, Subcontractor will provide repair services for a fee equal to the actual cost of these services. In the event
Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer’s Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the
Parties (the “Standards”), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within
thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer’s Products. Upon Manufacturer’s request, Subcontractor will
facilitate such Manufacturer’s Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer’s Products to
Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within fifteen (15) days of the end of such thirty (30) date notice

and all information concerning customers, suppliers, trade secrets, methods, processes or procedures and any other confidential,
financial and business information of the other Party that is marked “Confidential" or the like or, if delivered verbally, confirmed in
writing to be "Confidential" within thirty (30) days of the initial disclosure ("Confidential Information") with the same standard of
care as it uses for its own Confidential Information. Neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information to any third Party without
the prior written consent of the other party, except that both parties agree that the other party may disclose Confidential
Information to its auditors and contractors under an obligation of confidentiality, to governmental authorities having jurisdiction
over such Party or as otherwise required by applicable law, provided however, in the event the Manufacturer or Subcontractor is
ordered to provide Confidential Information by a lawful judicial or government order, the party who is subject to such order shall
promptly inform the Party whose information is to be disclosed and shall permit the Party to defend against such order of
disclosure and shall assist in such defense to the extent permitted by law. In no other circumstances may the Manufacturer or
Subcontractor disclose information without the consultation and prior written consent of the non-disclosing Party.

known or independently developed by the receiving Party, (iii) is acquired by the receiving Party from any third party having a
right to disclose such information or (iv) the receiving party is obligated to produce under a court or governmental order;
provided, the disclosing Party complies with the notice requirements of the previous paragraph with respect the information
subject to such court or governmental order. The Parties acknowledge that a breach by either Party of this Section 11 will give
rise to irreparable injury to the other, inadequately compensable in damages. Accordingly, the Parties hereby consent to allow the
other Party to seek injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of the undertakings of the Parties contained in this
Section 11. The Parties further agree that such an order so enjoining a Party may be issued pending final determination thereof,
without the requirement to post bond.
11.2 Public Announcements. Each Party reserves the right to publish press releases and public announcements
(collectively, the “Publications”) pertaining to this Agreement; provided, however, no Publications will contain any Confidential

which directly or indirectly result from, or arise in connection with, any negligent act or omission of the disclosing Party, its agents,
or employees, pertaining to such disclosing Party’s Publications under this Agreement.
11.3 Non-Use. Each Party to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that at any time during the Term of this
Agreement and at all times following the termination of this Agreement, neither Party may use any Confidential Information,

property of Subcontractor. In the event this Agreement terminates for any reason or no reason, all licenses of Subcontractor’s
patents, trademarks, software, trade secrets or other intellectual property (collectively the “Intellectual Property”) of

between Subcontractor and Manufacturer shall immediately terminate and Manufacturer must immediately cease use of all of
Subcontractor’s Intellectual Property.
12. Manufacturer's Indemnity.  Manufacturer shall indemnify, defend and hold Subcontractor and its affiliates
("Subcontractor Indemnities") harmless from and against any and all loss, liability or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
resulting from or arising in connection with any claim or suit by any third party against the Subcontractor Indemnities (i) alleging

agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
