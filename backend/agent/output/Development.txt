6.8 Withholding Taxes.
6.8.1 Withholding Amounts. Where any sum due to be paid to either Party hereunder is
subject to any withholding or similar tax, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to do all such acts and things and
to sign all such documents as will enable them to take advantage of any applicable double taxation agreement or treaty. In the event
there is no applicable double taxation agreement or treaty, or if an applicable double taxation agreement or treaty reduces but does not
eliminate such withholding or similar tax, the payor shall remit such withholding or similar tax to the appropriate government authority,
deduct the amount paid from the amount due to payee and secure and send to payee the best available evidence of the payment of
such withholding or similar tax. Any such amounts deducted by the payor in respect of such withholding or similar tax shall be treated
as having been paid by the payor for purposes of this Agreement. If withholding or similar taxes are paid to a government authority,
each Party will provide the other such assistance as is reasonably required to obtain a refund of the withheld or similar taxes, or to
obtain a credit with respect to such taxes paid. In the event that a government authority retroactively determines that a payment made
by the paying Party to the receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement should have been subject to withholding or similar (or to
additional withholding or similar) taxes, and such paying Party (the “Withholding Party”) remits such withholding or similar taxes to
the government authority, including any interest and penalties that may be imposed thereon (together with the tax paid, the
“Withholding Amount”), the Withholding Party will have the right (a) to offset the Withholding Amount against future payment
obligations of the Withholding Party under this Agreement or (b) to invoice the receiving Party for the Withholding Amount (which
shall be payable by the receiving Party within [***] of its receipt of such invoice), or to pursue reimbursement of the Withholding
Amount by any other available remedy.
6.8.2 Withholding Actions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that if AbbVie (or its assignee pursuant to Section 13.4) is required by Applicable Law to withhold taxes in respect of any
amount payable under this Agreement, and if such withholding obligation arises as a result of any action taken by AbbVie or its
Affiliate or successor or assignee, including without limitation an assignment of this Agreement as permitted under Section 13.4 of this
Agreement, a change in tax residency of AbbVie, or payments arise or are deemed to arise through a branch of AbbVie and such
withholding taxes exceed the amount of withholding taxes that would have been applicable if such action had not occurred (each an
“AbbVie Withholding Tax Action ”), then, any such amount payable shall be increased to take into account such increased
withholding taxes as may be necessary so that, after making all required withholdings Harpoon (or its assignee pursuant to Section
13.4) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such AbbVie Withholding Tax Action occurred. Harpoon
shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an exemption of such withheld amounts to the extent practicable under
Applicable Law and (b) cooperate with AbbVie to obtain a reduction or refund of such withheld amounts.
6.9 Indirect Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all payments due under this
Agreement are exclusive of value added taxes, sales taxes, consumption taxes and other similar taxes (the “ Indirect Taxes ”).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AbbVie shall be responsible for any Indirect Taxes as well as any
transfer, documentary, sales use, stamp, registration, value added or other similar tax that is imposed with respect to the payments or
the related transfer of rights or other property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. If the Indirect Taxes originally paid or
otherwise borne by the paying Party are in whole or in part subsequently determined not to have been chargeable, all reasonably
necessary steps will be taken by the receiving Party to receive a refund of these undue Indirect Taxes from the
- 40 -
Source: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020applicable governmental authority or other fiscal authority and any amount of undue Indirect Taxes repaid by such authority to the
receiving Party will be transferred to the paying Party within [***] of receipt.
6.10 Interest on Late Payments. If any payment due to either Party under this Agreement is not paid
when due, then such paying Party shall pay interest thereon (before and after any judgment) at [***] such interest to run from the
date on which payment of such sum became due until payment thereof in full together with such interest; provided however that
[***], then such interest [***], as adjusted from time to time on the [***].
6.11 Audit. AbbVie shall, shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Sublicensees to, keep complete and accurate books and records pertaining to Net Sales of Licensed Products, in sufficient
detail to calculate all amounts payable hereunder. At the request of Harpoon, AbbVie shall permit an independent public accounting
firm of nationally recognized standing designated by Harpoon and reasonably acceptable to AbbVie, [***], to audit the books and
records maintained pursuant to this Section 6.11 to ensure the accuracy of all reports and payments made hereunder, including any
permitted deductions from Net Sales pursuant to Section 1.108. Such examinations may not (a) be conducted for any [***] [***] (b)
be conducted more than once in any [***] period or (c) be [***] (unless a previous audit revealed an underpayment with respect to
such [***]). The accounting firm shall disclose to Harpoon only whether the reports are correct or not, and the specific details
concerning any discrepancies. No other information shall be shared. Except as provided below, the cost of this audit shall be borne by
Harpoon, unless the audit reveals a variance [***] from the reported amounts or [***], in which case AbbVie shall bear the cost of
the audit.
6.12 Audit Dispute. In the event of a dispute with respect to any audit under Section 6.11, Harpoon and
AbbVie shall work in good faith to resolve the disagreement. If the Parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any
such dispute within [***], the dispute shall be submitted for resolution to a certified public accounting firm jointly selected by each
Party’s certified public accountants or to such other Person as the Parties shall mutually agree (the “Audit Expert”). The decision of
the Audit Expert shall be final and the costs of such determination as well as the initial audit shall be borne between the Parties in
such manner as the Audit Expert shall determine.  Not later than [***] after such decision and in accordance with such decision,
AbbVie shall pay the additional amounts or Harpoon shall reimburse the excess payments, as applicable.
6.13 Confidentiality. The receiving Party shall treat all information subject to review under this Article 6
in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of Article 9 and the Parties shall cause the Audit Expert to enter into a reasonably
acceptable confidentiality agreement with AbbVie obligating such firm to retain all such financial information in confidence pursuant to
such confidentiality agreement.
6.14 [***] The development and regulatory milestone payments, first commercial sales milestone
payments, sales-based milestone payments and royalties in Sections 6.2, 6.3 6.4, and 6.5 shall not apply at the same rates to
Development and Commercialization of Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products [***] for eligibility to be treated for such disease,
state, or condition with a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product or for monitoring patients who are or have been treated with a
Licensed Compound or Licensed Product. In the event that a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product is Developed for any such
purposes, [***] for the sale of such Licensed Product that [***] of such Licensed Product and [***], as applicable; provided that, for

all consideration, compensation and benefits, monetary or otherwise, to be paid, granted or delivered by one Party to the other Party in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein. Neither Party previously has paid or entered into any other commitment to pay,
whether orally or in writing, any of the other Party’s employees, directly or indirectly, any consideration, compensation or benefits,
monetary or otherwise, in connection with the transaction contemplated herein.

Patents, then solely following the License Option Exercise Closing Date, AbbVie may prosecute such infringement in the Territory at
its own expense, unless Harpoon reasonably believes that the prosecution of such infringement by AbbVie would have a material
adverse impact on Harpoon’s global patent portfolio, or upon the use or application of such Harpoon Patents in connection with other
products and compounds Controlled by Harpoon, its Affiliates or sublicensees. For clarity, this Section 7.3.2(b) is inapplicable to any
biosimilar patent litigation relating to any Licensed Compound or Licensed Product as set forth in Sections 7.3.3 and 7.3.4.

the first right to bring an action for infringement of the AbbVie Patents, Joint Patents, Product-Specific Patents and, upon the written
consent of Harpoon, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (taking into account, without limitation, the
potential impact of such consent on Harpoon’s platform technology and/or other products undergoing development or
commercialization by Harpoon or its Third Party licensees and covered by such Harpoon Patents), other Harpoon Patents, including
as required under Section 351(l)(6) of the PHSA following the agreement on a list of patents for litigation under Section 351(l)(4) or
exchange of Patent lists pursuant to Section 351(l)(5)(B) of such act, or as required following any equivalent or similar certification or
notice in any other jurisdiction. If Harpoon decides pursuant to this Agreement not to allow AbbVie to include such other Harpoon
Patents in a litigation against a biosimilar applicant for a biosimilar product, Harpoon shall not assert such Patent in any litigation
against the same biosimilar applicant for the same biosimilar product without written approval by AbbVie. The Parties’ rights and
obligations with respect to the foregoing legal actions shall be as set forth in Sections 7.3.1 through 7.3.5; provided that within [***]
of reaching agreement on a list of Patents for litigation under Section 351(l)(4) or exchange of Patent lists pursuant to Section 351(l)
(5)(B), AbbVie shall notify Harpoon as to whether or not it elects to prosecute such infringement. Either Party shall, within [***],
notify and provide the other Party with copies of any notice of commercial marketing provided by the filer of a Biosimilar Application
pursuant to Section 351(l)(8)(A) of the PHSA, or any equivalent or similar certification or notice in any other jurisdiction. Thereafter,

otherwise set forth herein, the Party entitled to bring any patent infringement litigation in accordance with this Section 7.3 shall have
the right to settle such claim; provided that neither Party shall have the right to settle any patent infringement litigation under this
Section 7.3 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express
written consent of such other Party. The Party commencing the litigation shall provide the other Party with copies of all pleadings and
other documents filed with the court if doing so would not waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law, and shall
consider reasonable input from the other Party during the course of the proceedings.
7.3.6 Recovery. Any recovery realized as a result of such litigation described in Section 7.3.1,

shall promptly notify Harpoon thereof in writing. Subject to Section 11.2, AbbVie shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to
defend and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, using counsel of its own choice. Harpoon
may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding with counsel of its choice at its own expense. The assumption of the defense of
a claim that may be subject to Section 11.2 by either AbbVie or Harpoon shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that Harpoon
is liable to indemnify any AbbVie Indemnitee in respect of such indemnity claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by Harpoon of any
defenses it may assert against an AbbVie Indemnitee’s claim for indemnification. Without limitation of the foregoing, if AbbVie finds it
necessary or desirable to join Harpoon as a party to any such action, Harpoon shall, at AbbVie’s expense, execute all papers and
perform such acts as shall be reasonably required. If AbbVie elects (in a written communication submitted to Harpoon within a
reasonable amount of time after notice of the alleged patent infringement) not to defend or control the defense of, or otherwise fails to
initiate and maintain the defense of, any such claim, suit, or proceeding, within such time periods so that Harpoon is not prejudiced by
any delays, Harpoon may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense. Each Party shall

or control the defense of such Harpoon Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense
of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then solely with respect to Product-Specific Patents included in the Harpoon Patents, and

Patents with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant
time shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding. If the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the
relevant time elects not to defend or control the defense of the Joint Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to
initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then the other Party may conduct and control the defense of
any such claim, suit, or proceeding, at its own expense.

consider in good faith any comments from the other Party and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed of any steps taken, and
shall provide copies of all documents filed, in connection with such defense, claim, or counterclaim provided that doing so would not
waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law. In connection with the activities set forth in this Section 7.5, each
Party shall consult with the other as to the strategy for the defense of the Harpoon Patents and Joint Patents. Neither Party shall
have the right to settle any claim, suit, or proceeding under this Section 7.5 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or
involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party.
7.5.5 Relationship to Enforcement of Patents.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or patentability of any of the Harpoon Patents, AbbVie Patents, or
Joint Patents that is raised in connection with or in response to an infringement action or a biosimilar litigation shall be controlled by
the Party who controls that infringement action or biosimilar litigation, and such Party shall have the right to manage, resolve, settle or
dispose any such challenge according to Section 7.3, provided that (a) with respect to any Harpoon Patents that are not Product-
Specific Patents and are not involved in any biosimilar patent litigation, where AbbVie is the controlling Party in connection with an
infringement action, AbbVie shall not resolve, settle or dispose of such action or litigation in any way that would admit liability on the
part of Harpoon, or materially impact the validity, scope or enforceability of such Harpoon Patent, without Harpoon’s prior written
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (b) with respect to any Harpoon Patents for which Harpoon did not give its
consent to include within a biosimilar litigation, and Harpoon is the controlling Party in connection with an infringement action involving
such Patents, then Harpoon shall be the controlling Party in connection with the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or

Party. In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, with regard to such prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense,
the interests of the Parties as collaborators and Harpoon and licensee are to, for their mutual benefit, obtain patent protection and plan
patent defense against potential infringement activities by Third Parties, and as such, are aligned and are legal in nature. The Parties
agree and acknowledge that they have not waived, and nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver of, any legal privilege
concerning Patents under this Article 7, including privilege under the common interest doctrine and similar or related doctrines.

ARTICLE 11
INDEMNITY
11.1 Indemnification of Harpoon. AbbVie shall indemnify Harpoon, its Affiliates and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (the “Harpoon Indemnitees ”) and defend and save each of them harmless,
from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs, taxes (including penalties and interest) and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (collectively, “ Losses ”) in connection with any and all suits, investigations,
claims, or demands of Third Parties (collectively, “Third Party Claims”) incurred by or rendered against the Harpoon Indemnitees
arising from or occurring as a result of: [***]
11.2 Indemnification of AbbVie.  Harpoon shall indemnify AbbVie, its Affiliates and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (the “ AbbVie Indemnitees ”), and defend and save each of them harmless,
from and against any and all Losses in connection with any and all Third Party Claims incurred by or rendered against the AbbVie
Indemnitees arising from or occurring as a result of: [***]
11.3 Notice of Claim. All indemnification claims in respect of a Party, its Affiliates, or their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents shall be made solely by such Party to this Agreement (the “ Indemnified Party”). The
Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice (an “Indemnification Claim Notice ”) of any Losses or
discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under this Article 11, but in no
event shall the indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses to the extent resulting from any delay in providing such notice. Each
Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent 
- 59 -
Source: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020that the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying
Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.
11.4 Control of Defense.
11.4.1 In General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.4 (if applicable), 7.5 and 7.6, at its
option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party
within [***] after the indemnifying Party’s receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third
Party Claim by the indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify
the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it
may assert against the Indemnified Party’s claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the
indemnifying Party which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event the indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying Party all original notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Should the
indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in Section 11.4.2, the indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim unless specifically requested in writing by the indemnifying Party. In the
event that it is ultimately determined that the indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Indemnified
Party from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for any Losses incurred
by the indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party Claim.
11.4.2 Right to Participate in Defense.  Without limiting Section 11.4.1, any Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for
such purpose; provided that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Party’s own expense unless (a) the employment thereof,
and the assumption by the indemnifying Party of such expense, has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying Party in writing,
(b) the indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 11.4.1 (in which case the
Indemnified Party shall control the defense), or (c) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party with respect to
such Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both Parties under Applicable
Law, ethical rules or equitable principles (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall control its defense and the Indemnified Party
shall control the defense of the Indemnified Party).
11.4.3 Settlement.  With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money
damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that shall not result in the Indemnified Party’s becoming subject to injunctive or
other relief, and as to which the indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party hereunder, the indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or
otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate. With respect to
all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party

DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT  
This Development Agreement (“Development Agreement”) is entered into on April 15, 2010 (“EffectiveDate”) by and between Cargill, Incorporated through its Bio Technology Development Center, having its principal place of business at 15407 McGinty Road West, Wayzata, Minnesota 55391 USA (“Cargill”) and Bioamber S.A.S., having a place of business at Route de Bazancourt, F-51110, Pomacle France (“Bioamber”). Bioamber and Cargill shall be referred to individually as “Party” and collectively as “Parties”, as required by text.  
Background    
  
  
Cargill and Bioamber mutually agree as follows:  
  
  
  
  
  Cargill Confidential  - 1 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
  A. Cargill has developed a yeast strain designated CB1 (“CB1”) for fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams and related research tools for modifying CB1,which are protected by Licensed Patents (as defined in Section 2.5 below). 
  B. Bioamber desires to engage Cargill to further develop or modify CB1 with the goal of fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams to produce succinic acid and salts thereof. 
  C. The Parties desire to grant each other certain rights to use the further developed or modified CB1 as well as other technology that is developed in the course of the work as provided in this Development Agreement for research purposes only. 
1. Scope of Work Plan 
1.1 Cargill agrees to perform the services to develop or modify CB1 to produce succinic acid and salts thereof using dextrose (defined as glucose) and/or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock (“Work Plan”). The Work Plan is more fully described in Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Development Agreement. CB1 that has been further developed or modified (or the like) under the Work Plan shall be referred to as “Modified CB1”. Any changes to the Work Plan must be in writing and signed by both Cargill and Bioamber and may be subject to incremental fees depending on resource requirements. 
1.2 In agreeing to perform the Work Plan, Cargill represents and warrants that: 
  1.2.1Cargill has the capability, experience, and means necessary to perform the Work Plan, and the Work Plan will be performed using personnel, equipment, and material qualified and suitable to perform the Work Plan requested; 
thCargill Confidential  - 2 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
 
1.2.2Cargill will provide properly trained and informed personnel, and Cargill will be solely responsible for the negligent acts, errors and omissions of its employees, subcontractors, and agents and for any other person performing services under this Development Agreement at the direct request of Cargill; 
  1.2.3Cargill will perform the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with reasonable skill and care ordinarily exercised by members of the profession practicing under similar conditions and in accordance with accepted industry practices and professional guidelines; 
  1.2.4Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill has in effect and will maintain in effect all permits, licenses and other authorizations necessary to perform the Work Plan; and 
 
1.2.5No other party has rights to its services as described in the Work Plan, and that a work assignment from any third party shall not be accepted, or work by Cargill aloneshall not be conducted, to develop CB1 or other microorganisms that will be used to (a) directly produce succinic acid and salts thereof, or (b) indirectly produce succinic acid and salts thereof (for example, Cargill may develop microorganisms to produce precursors of succinic acid, such as fumaric acid and malic acid, so long as such precursors are not converted to succinic acid, such as by chemical modification), for the Term (as defined in Section 10.1) of this Development Agreement. For purposes of clarity, and as examples, Cargill may sell dextrose as fermentation feedstock to third parties, who may use such dextrose to produce succinic acid; also, Cargill may modify starches to make succinic acid starch derivatives. 
2. Fees and Milestones  
2.1 Bioamber shall pay Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Development Agreement. 
2.2 In addition to the payment in Section 2.1, Bioamber shall pay Cargill a total of [***] U.S. Dollars ($[***] per year per full-time equivalent (FTE) person to perform the Work Plan, and Cargill will make available up to [***] FTE persons per year to perform the work as outlined in the Work Plan. Such total is subject to change based on an annual review of the needs and requirements of the Work Plan. The actual number of FTEs assigned at any given time will be a function of the Work Plan and will be subject to agreement amongst the Parties. In addition, Bioamber will pay for reasonable expenses incurred by Cargill, including travel. Cargill shall cover ordinary and customary [***]. Cargill shall submit to Bioamber a monthly invoice for costs owed by Bioamber, accompanied by a report summarizing Cargill’s activities in relation to actual hours worked and expenses incurred. Bioamber will pay Cargill’s costs within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and supporting documentation. Bioamber shall have the right to audit Cargill time sheets from time to time. Such audit shall occur once per year during reasonable business hours by an independent third party agreed to by both parties, who shall be under obligations of confidentiality.Cargill Confidential  - 3 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
2.3 Bioamber shall also pay Cargill within thirty (30) days of achieving each of the milestones summarized below and more fully described in the Work Plan found in Exhibit A. For purposes of clarity, payment is triggered [***]. Further, each of the Milestones and Target Dates may be changed according to the needs of the Work Plan and upon written agreement by the parties. 
Milestone   Target Date   Payment Milestone 1: Proof of Concept   12 months after Effective Date  US $250,000.00Milestone 2: CB1 Strain Development   30 months after Effective Date  US $300,000.00Milestone 3: CB1 Strain Optimization   42 months after Effective Date  US $500,000.00
2.4 Missed Milestones. 
 
2.4.1In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and subsequently achieves such milestone as per the criteria described in Exhibit A, the payment for such missed milestone shall be due [***] and the amount due shall be [***] for every [***] beyond the Target Date. The Target Date for subsequent Milestones will be adjusted to reflect the date on which the Milestone was actually achieved. If a subsequent Milestone is achieved by the original Target Date listed in Section 2.3, Bioamber will pay Cargill the amount [***]. For purposes of clarity and as examples, if Milestones 1 and 2 were not delivered by the Target Dates, but Milestone 3 is delivered by or before the Target Date, then the total payments due to Cargill at that time would be [***] (a total payment of $[***]). Another example is if [***], the payment due at that time would be a total of $[***]. 
 
2.4.2In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and Bioamber decides to commercialize Modified CB1, any outstanding milestone payments shall immediately become due such that the total payment due Cargill under this Development Agreement equals One Million Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,050,000.00).Cargill Confidential  - 4 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
  2.4.3Provided that Cargill has respected its undertakings set out in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement, no other damages shall accrue to Cargill for not achieving a given Milestone other than provided in Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.5. 
2.5 Option to Research License. In the event Cargill (i) is unable to achieve a given milestone described in Section 2.3 by the Target Date, or (ii) terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Bioamber shall have the option to obtain a license during the term of this Development Agreement to the patent applications and patents listed in Exhibit B (including any continuations, continued prosecutions, continuations-in-part, reissues, reexaminations, divisions or substitutions thereof) (collectively “Licensed Patents”), the tool kit listed in Exhibit C (“Licensed Tool Kit”), and Cargill Improvements if any (as defined in Section 5.2 below), for research use only and for additional monetary consideration (“Research License”). Except for financial terms paid by third parties for [***], the Research License shall be offered to Bioamber at [***]. Such research use shall be for the development and optimization of CB1 for the production of succinic acid and salts thereof using dextrose or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock. The Research License shall be provided to Bioamber only, with no rights to sublicense and with no “have made” rights. Notwithstanding the preceding, Bioamber will be permitted to outsource development work as outlined in the Work Plan and according to the Research License to third parties that have been approved by Cargill, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In considering whether or not to outsource such development work to third parties, the Parties recognize that it is in their mutual interest to protect CB1, Modified CB1, Cargill Confidential Information (as defined in Section 4.1), and Know-How and Licensed Patents (as those terms are defined under the Commercial License Agreement) and, therefore, the Parties shall undertake joint evaluations of third parties who have been identified by Bioamber to perform such development work, including, for example and not by limitation, a risk assessment of the geography in which such development work will occur, and whether or not such third parties have similar guiding principles as Cargill (a copy of Cargill’s Guiding Principles and Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property is attached as Exhibit F). Such development work shall not be conducted by such third parties in circumstances where Cargill’s intellectual property is at an unacceptable risk as determined by Cargill based on the joint evaluations of such third parties. The terms and conditions of such Research License shall be negotiated between the Parties and shall include the terms described in this Section 2.5 and terms addressing ownership and rights to use of any intellectual property developed. Further, this Development Agreement shall serve as the framework for the Research License. 
2.6 Technology Transfer. In the event Milestone 3 is achieved, Cargill will provide up to [***] to assist in a successful transfer of the Modified CB1 technology to Bioamber in order to allow subsequent scale-up at the same FTE rate set forth in Section 2.2. For clarity, [***] per FTE per year equals US$[***] for this technology transfer).Cargill Confidential  - 5 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
2.7 Scale-Up. Following the successful technology transfer, upon request by Bioamber and subject to Cargill’s availability of appropriate resources, Cargill will enter at its sole discretion into a services agreement with Bioamber to assist in the fermentation scale-up of using Modified CB1 obtained under Milestones 2 and 3 for producing succinic acid and salts thereof at a single Bioamber facility or a facility designated by Bioamber. Cargill shall invoice Bioamber [***] U.S. Dollars (US$[***]) per man-day provided, not inclusive of taxes or other governmental fees, and further adjusted for inflation at the time it goes into effect. Cargill shall have no obligation to perform scale-up work at Cargill facilities. 
3. Alternative Feedstock. Bioamber also desires the right to further develop CB1 to utilize cellulosic biomass as the fermentation feedstock. Cargill hereby grants Bioamber the option to modify or convert the Work Plan to include the development or modification of CB1 capable of fermenting such cellulosic feedstock (“Modified Work Plan”). If such option is exercised, (a) the terms and conditions of this Development Agreement shall apply to the Modified Work Plan except (i) new, additional up-front and milestone payments shall apply as provided below, and (ii) any development work performed under the Modified Work Plan will be at a FTE rate which will be equivalent to the FTE rate provided in Section 2.2 above and further adjusted for inflation at the time it goes into effect; and (b) the commercial license attached as Exhibit D shall be expanded to include the resulting strain developed out of the Modified Work Plan with no additional change in the financial terms. Additionally, the additional up-front fee [***].

4. Confidentiality. To carry out the Work Plan, Cargill may receive from, and provide to, Bioamber certain Confidential Information, as defined below. Such Confidential Information will be disclosed by one Party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) on the following terms and conditions: 
4.1 “Confidential Information” means all business, technical, and financial information related to the Work Plan, the terms and discussions relating to the Term Sheet executed by the parties on December 3, 2009 and December 4, 2009, and to any aspect of the business of each Party that is material to the Work Plan, including, without limitation, Licensed Tool Kit, products, product compositions, raw materials, specifications, formulae, equipment, business plans and strategies, customer lists, supplier lists, know-how, samples, drawings, pricing informationand other financial information, inventions, ideas, research information, packaging, manufacturing processes, and other information, or its potential use, that is owned by or in possession of either Party. For purposes of clarity, the parties shall not disclose to each other any Confidential Information that is not material to the Work Plan, such as, by way of example and without limitation, processes and other information relating to post-fermentation activities. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (a) is in the public domain prior to disclosure by Disclosing Party; (b) becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no unauthorized act or omission by the Receiving Party; (c) is lawfully in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; or (d) is independently developed by an employee(s) of the Receiving Party with no access to the disclosed Confidential Information.Cargill Confidential  - 6 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
4.2 The Receiving Party agrees to take and maintain proper and appropriate steps to protect Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party agrees to disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to employees or agents of the Receiving Party who are directly involved with the Work Plan contemplated by this Development Agreement, and even then only to such extent as is necessary and essential to perform the Work Plan. The Receiving Party agrees to inform such employees and agents of the confidential nature of the information disclosed hereunder and to cause all such employees and agents to abide by the terms of this Development Agreement. 
4.3 The Receiving Party shall not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any unauthorized party without the Disclosing Party’s prior express written consent or unless required by court order or order of a similar governmental entity. If a Party is required by court order or order of a similar governmental entity to disclose the other’s Confidential Information, they shall give the other Party prompt notice of such requirement so that an appropriate protective order or other relief may be sought. 
4.4 The Receiving Party will use Confidential Information only in connection with the Work Plan. Both Parties have reserved all rights to their respective Confidential Information not expressly granted herein. All documents and/or tangible materials containing or comprising Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party will remain the property of the Disclosing Party. Upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and any documents prepared by the Receiving Party using Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party agrees to provide confirmation of such destruction in writing. The Receiving Party may, however, keep one copy of any such document in the files of its legal department or outside counsel for record purposes only. 
4.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Development Agreement, each Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of confidentiality and use as provided in this Section may result in irreparable harm and damages to the Disclosing Party in an amount difficult to ascertain and that cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary award. Accordingly, in addition to any other relief to which the Disclosing Party may be entitled at law or in equity, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek a temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief from any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party.Cargill Confidential  - 7 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
4.6 The obligations imposed by this section, including but not limited to non-disclosure and non-use, however, will endure so long as the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party does not become part of the public domain. 
4.7 The existence of and the terms of this Development Agreement, including its Exhibits, are confidential and are not to be disclosed without the prior written approval of Cargill. 
4.8 Neither Party may make any public announcement concerning this Development Agreement, its subject matter, and the activities and actions it contemplates without the other Party’s express written consent. 
4.9 This Section 4 supercedes and replaces the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties, which was effective July 17, 2009. All Confidential Information that was subject to that Mutual Confidentiality Agreement is hereby made subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4. 
5. Intellectual Property 
5.1 Each party shall retain ownership of all intellectual property that it owned prior to the Effective Date. 
5.2 Improvements. Any invention or discovery relating to the Work Plan, in whole or in part, that is conceived during the term of this Development Agreement shall be an “Improvement”. The scope for Improvements will be limited to the CB1 strain itself and the [***] (the “Field”), but shall exclude [***]. Bioamber will own any Improvement in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof and such Improvement shall be designated “Bioamber Improvements”. Cargill will own any Improvement in all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, and such Improvement shall be designated “Cargill Improvements”. In the event it is not clear as to ownership of any Improvement as described in this Section 5.2, in other words, if it is not clear whether an invention or discovery is either a Bioamber Improvement or a Cargill Improvement, such Improvement shall be [***] and such Improvement shall be designated “Joint Improvements”. For purposes of clarity, as examples, Cargill Improvements are those inventions relating to fumaric acid and malic acid. Additionally, where an Improvement has applications both in the Field and outside the Field, then such Improvement, as it applies to the Field, shall be a Bioamber Improvement and, as it applies outside the Field, such Improvement shall be a Cargill Improvement. 
 
5.2.1Cargill hereby grants Bioamber, and Bioamber hereby accepts, an exclusive, royalty-free license to Cargill Improvements and Joint Improvements for use in the Field during the term of this Development Agreement with a reservation of right for Cargill to practice such Cargill Improvements and Joint Improvements for use in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof during the term of this Development Agreement. Such use shall be for research purposes only with no rights to sublicense and with no “have made” rights. Cargill shall also grant a commercial license to Bioamber for Cargill Improvements and Joint Improvements under the terms and conditions of Exhibit D.Cargill Confidential  - 8 -  * Confidential treatment requested 
 
5.2.2Bioamber hereby grants Cargill, and Cargill hereby accepts, an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license with an unlimited right to sublicense under and to Bioamber Improvements for use outside the Field during the term of this Development Agreement. Such use shall be for research purposes only. 
 
5.2.3Cargill shall have the first option to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain patent applications and issued/granted patents on Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements, which option may be waived in whole or in part. Cargill shall bear all costs incurred in connection with such preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of U.S. and foreign application(s) and issued/granted patents directed to Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements. Cargill shall provide Bioamber a copy of any proposed patent application covering Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements in advance of the submission of the proposed patent application to any patent office. However, Cargill shall be entitled to file provisional patent applications without seeking Bioamber’s approval. If Cargill waives its option, Bioamber shall have the option to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain patent applications and issued patents on Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements. Cargill shall provide, when requested by Bioamber, all information in its possession, or true copies thereof, pertaining to Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements which may be necessary or useful in the preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications covering the Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements. Such information shall be treated as Confidential Information. 
 
5.2.4If Cargill waives its option to prepare and prosecute a patent application in accordance with Section 5.2.3 and elects not to file such a patent application or elects to allow any such patent application or issued/granted patent to become abandoned or lapse, Cargill shall give Bioamber notice of such election promptly and at least two (2) months prior to the first date that action must be taken to avoid such abandonment or lapse. Bioamber shall have the right to take over at its sole expense the filing, prosecution or maintenance of any such patent application and Bioamber shall keep Cargill informed of Bioamber’s filing, prosecution, and maintenance activities. All out-of-pocket expenses of Cargill shall be reimbursed by Bioamber.

provided, in each case, that if conditional Regulatory Approval in a geographic territory specified above in Section 6.1.1, 6.1.2 or
6.1.3 is obtained on the basis of Successful Phase 3 Interim Analysis but unconditional Regulatory Approval is not obtained (i.e.,

6.2 Payment Adjustments. In the event that the actual Development Costs paid or incurred by SFJ hereunder are lower or
greater than One Hundred Twenty Million U.S. Dollars ($120,000,000.00), including by reason of any amount of Going Concern
Funding paid by SFJ to
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020PB in accordance with Section 4.2.4, or in the event that such actual Development Costs are subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.3.3, Section 3.12.2 and/or Section 3.12.3, the Approval Payments will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is such actual amount of Development Costs paid or incurred by SFJ hereunder (as adjusted, to the extent applicable,
pursuant to Section 2.3.3, Section 3.12.2 and/or Section 3.12.3) and the denominator of which is One Hundred Twenty Million
U.S. Dollars ($120,000,000.00). In the event that Regulatory Approval is obtained in a particular jurisdiction while Development
Costs for other jurisdiction(s) are still being paid or incurred, in which case the Parties shall recalculate the applicable adjustment at
such time as the final amount of actual Development Costs is known and determine any true-up payments required to be made by
PB with respect to any payment made pursuant to Section 6.1 prior to such time, and PB shall pay any such true-up payment to
SFJ within [***] after receipt of invoice from SFJ.
6.3 Method and Timing of Payment. The US Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments and Japan/China Approval
Payments to SFJ will be due as of the applicable annual anniversary of the date of the applicable Regulatory Approval. SFJ shall
deliver invoices to PB for the US Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments and Japan/China Approval Payments at least [***]
before the applicable anniversary of the date of Regulatory Approval, and such payments will be made by PB on or before the
later of (a) [***] and (b) [***] following delivery of such invoices, by wire transfer to SFJ’s account that SFJ shall designate on
such invoice. PB will provide SFJ with written notice of each wire transfer to SFJ’s account. All amounts payable and calculations
under this Agreement shall be in US dollars.
6.4 Late Payments. If PB fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement on the due date therefore, then, without
prejudice to any other remedies that SFJ may have, that amount will bear interest from the due date until payment of such amount
is made, both before and after any judgment, at a rate equal to, [***] percent ([***]%) per annum computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days for the actual number of days payment is delinquent or if such rate exceeds the maximum amount permitted by
Applicable Law, at such maximum rate.
6.5 Taxes. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that payments made under this Agreement will be made without
reduction for withholding or similar taxes, unless such withholding or similar tax is required (x) by a taxing authority as a result of an
audit or examination, (y) due to the assignment of this Agreement or any payment obligation hereunder (to the extent permitted) by
SFJ to an Affiliate or Third Party, or (z) as a result of a change in Applicable Laws at any time during the Term. In such case, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable and legal efforts to mitigate the amount of such taxes that would need to be withheld
and/or paid. Any amounts withheld pursuant to this Section 6.5 will be timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, and will
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Party that otherwise would have received such amounts. In
the event of a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code that withholding or similar taxes were required
but were not properly withheld, the Party that received the relevant payment will indemnify and hold the other Party harmless with
respect to such taxes and related Losses.
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/20206.6 Tax Cooperation. The Parties will cooperate and produce on a timely basis any tax forms or reports, including any IRS
Forms W-8BEN or W-9, as applicable, reasonably requested by the other Party in connection with any payment made under this
Agreement. Each Party will provide to the other Party any tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for such Party not
to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. Each Party will provide to the
other Party any tax forms at least [***] prior to the due date for any such payments. Each Party will provide the other with
commercially reasonable assistance to enable the recovery, as permitted by law, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations
resulting from payments made under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of the Party bearing such withholding tax
or VAT. Each Party will provide commercially reasonable cooperation to the other Party, at the other Party’s expense, in
connection with any official or unofficial tax audit or contest relating to tax payments made with respect to amounts paid or payable
to such other Party under this Agreement.
6.7 Buy-Out Option.
6.7.1 Approval Buy-Out Option. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the receipt of Regulatory

Japan/China Payment, as applicable, payable pursuant to Section 6.1 as a result of such Regulatory Approval, in each case, as
adjusted in accordance with Section 6.2) by written notice delivered to SFJ no later than [***] after the date of such Regulatory
Approval, which written notice shall set forth the amount of the applicable Approval Buy-Out Payment, the proposed date of

discount rate used to calculate each Approval Buy-Out Payment shall be [***] percent ([***]%).
6.7.2 Change of Control Buy-Out Option. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the closing of a
Change of Control, PB or its successor shall have the right to make a one-time payment (the “Change of Control Buy-Out
Payment”) in lieu of all (but not less than all) remaining Approval Payments for the applicable country(ies) in which Regulatory
Approval has been received as of the date of closing of such Change of Control, provided that SFJ has not previously assigned the
right to receive the Approval Payments to a Third Party, in which event PB or its successor shall not have such right. To exercise
its right to make the Change of Control Buy-Out Payment, PB or its successor shall provide written notice to SFJ (the “Change of
Control Buy-Out Notice”) no later than [***] after the date of closing of such Change of Control, which written notice shall set
forth the amount of the applicable Change of

The discount rate used to calculate each Change of Control Buy-Out Payment shall be [***] percent ([***]%). For the avoidance
of doubt, the Change of Control Buy-Out Payment shall only apply with regard to Approvals which have already been obtained
prior to the Change of Control.
ARTICLE 7

notwithstanding, in no event shall the SFJ Collateral include, and PB shall not grant and shall not be deemed to have granted a
security interest in, (1) any property to the extent that such grant of security interest is prohibited by any Applicable Law of a
Governmental Authority or constitutes a breach or default under or results in the termination of or requires any consent not
obtained under, any contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document evidencing or giving rise to such property, except
to the extent that such Applicable Law or the term in such contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document providing for
such prohibition, breach, default or termination or requiring such consent is ineffective under Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-
409 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of Delaware (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant
jurisdiction or any other Applicable Law (including bankruptcy or insolvency statutes) or principles of equity; provided, however,

extent severable, shall attach immediately to any portion of the SFJ Collateral that does not result in such consequences or (2) any
of PB’s rights, title or interest in any of the outstanding voting capital stock or other ownership interests of a CFC in excess of 65%
of the voting power of all classes of capital stock or other ownership interests of CFC entitled to vote. This Agreement shall create
a continuing security interest in the SFJ Collateral which shall remain in effect until all PB Obligations (other than contingent
indemnity obligations) have been paid or otherwise satisfied in full in accordance with this Agreement and/or, if applicable, the

7.2 Priority of Security Interest. PB represents, warrants and covenants that, subject to fulfilment of PB’s obligations under
Section 7.4 and SFJ making any filings necessary to achieve such perfection, the security interest granted to SFJ pursuant to this

applicable), financing statements, amendments to financing statements, continuation financing statements, termination statements,
security agreements relating to the SFJ Collateral constituting intellectual property, fixture filings (if applicable), notices and other
documents and instruments, in form satisfactory to SFJ as SFJ may reasonably request, to perfect and continue perfected, maintain
the priority of or provide notice of SFJ’s security interest in the SFJ Collateral and to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement,
without notice to PB, with all appropriate jurisdictions located within the United States and the Designated European Countries.
Such financing statements may indicate the SFJ Collateral as substantially the same as the SFJ Collateral described in Section 7.1
or words of similar effect, or as being of an equal or lesser scope, or with greater detail, all in SFJ’s reasonable discretion.
7.4 Subordination to SVB Loan. On or before the Initial Funding Date, PB shall negotiate in good faith and enter into a
subordination agreement with SVB and SFJ reflecting in all material respects the terms described on Exhibit P attached hereto,

indebtedness of PB to SVB, which agreement shall (a) limit the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of PB to SVB that will
be senior to SFJ at [***], (b) include a provision pursuant to which in certain circumstances SFJ shall be entitled in its discretion to
purchase or repay all obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations) owing by PB to SVB arising under or in connection
with the SVB Loan Agreement in exchange for a release of SVB’s Liens on PB’s assets, (c) include an obligation on the part of
SFJ to, in connection with any refinancing or

event the arbitrator agrees with PB, PB shall be entitled to enter into the Licensing Transaction; [***], and, [***].

required by the SVB Loan Agreement to grant a security interest in the SFJ Collateral to SFJ and to incur the PB Obligations as
set forth herein (the “SVB Consent”). The failure of PB to obtain the SVB Consent within [***] of the Effective Date shall be
deemed to be a Material Adverse Event.
7.6.2 Government Compliance.
7.6.2.1 Maintain its and all its subsidiaries’ legal existence and good standing in their respective
jurisdictions of formation and maintain qualification in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on PB’s business or operations, provided that any subsidiary may liquidate or dissolve

business or operations, and provided that in connection with such liquidation or dissolution all assets and property of any such
subsidiary shall be transferred to PB or another subsidiary of PB. PB shall comply, and shall cause each subsidiary to comply, in all

conducting Development of the Product to, maintain, in good scientific manner, complete and accurate books and records

ARTICLE 10 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
10.1 Confidentiality. Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the
Parties (including, if applicable, in the Program Transfer Agreement), each Party (each, a “Receiving Party”) agrees that, during the
Term and for the [***] period following the expiration or termination of this Agreement (except that the obligations will survive
thereafter with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under Applicable Law) or such longer periods
for which such Confidential Information may be maintained pursuant to ARTICLE 9, it will keep confidential and will not publish or
otherwise disclose and will not use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program
Transfer Agreement (which includes the exercise of any rights or the performance of any obligations hereunder or thereunder) any
Confidential Information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other Party (each, a “Disclosing Party”) or its Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement. The foregoing obligations will not apply to any portion of
such information or materials that the Receiving Party can demonstrate:
10.1.1 was publicly disclosed by the Disclosing Party before or after such Confidential Information becomes
known to the Receiving Party;
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/202010.1.2 was already known to the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates, other than under an obligation of
confidentiality or non-use, prior to when it was received from the Disclosing Party;
10.1.3 is subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates by a Third Party lawfully in
possession thereof without obligation to keep such Confidential Information confidential;
10.1.4 has been published by a Third Party or otherwise enters the public domain through no fault of the Receiving
Party or any of its Affiliates in breach of this Agreement; or
10.1.5 has been independently developed by the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates, without the aid,
application or use of any Confidential Information of the other Party.
10.2 Authorized Disclosure. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information belonging to the other Party to the extent
such disclosure is reasonably necessary for complying with Applicable Laws, including regulations promulgated by securities
exchanges, provided that the Party required to disclose such information promptly notifies the Disclosing Party prior to making any
such disclosure and cooperates with the Disclosing Party’s efforts to seek confidential treatment or to otherwise limit disclosure.
Each Receiving Party may disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to its Affiliates, employees, agents, advisors, and
independent contractors (including Permitted Third Parties) engaged by such Receiving Party, in each case (a) only to the extent
such Persons need to know the Confidential Information solely in connection with the performance of this Agreement or, if
applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement and (b) provided that each Person receiving Confidential Information must be bound
by obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as stringent as an equivalent in scope to those set forth in this ARTICLE 10
prior to any such disclosure and the Party making such disclosure to such Person shall be liable to the other Party for any breach of
such obligations by such disclosee. PB may disclose SFJ Confidential Information to MedImmune as necessary to comply with
PB’s obligations or exercise PB’s rights under the AZ License (it being understood that any such disclosure will be made under the
terms of Article 6 of the AZ License and that PB shall not be required to enter into any further confidentiality agreement with
MedImmune for such purpose). Each Party may also disclose the material terms of this Agreement (including the form of Program
Transfer Agreement) or provide a copy of this Agreement or a summary of such Party’s findings during its due diligence
investigation of the Products (if applicable) to any bona fide potential or actual investor, investment banker, acquirer, provider of
debt or royalty financing, or other potential or actual financial partner without consent of the other Party, and provided that in
connection with such disclosure, each disclosee must be bound by obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as stringent as
an equivalent in scope to those set forth in this ARTICLE 10 prior to any such disclosure and the Party making such disclosure to
such disclosee shall be liable to the other Party for any breach of such obligations by such disclosee. Notwithstanding anything in
the foregoing to the contrary, Exhibit D constitutes PB’s Confidential Information and not SFJ’s Confidential Information, and PB
may disclose Exhibit D to Third Parties as determined by PB in its sole discretion. In any event, each Party agrees to
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020take all reasonable action to avoid unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information of the other Party hereunder.
10.3 Return of Confidential Information. Except as otherwise provided herein, upon expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement, all Confidential Information (including any copies thereof) in written or other tangible form will, at the Disclosing
Party’s direction, be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed by the Receiving Party, and any Person(s) to whom the
Receiving Party disclosed (with such destruction being certified in writing by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party), except
(i) to the extent such Confidential Information is necessary to exercise any license and/or rights hereunder that survive such
expiration or earlier termination; and (ii) one (1) copy of each document may be retained by the Receiving Party solely to the
extent necessary to permit it to comply with any ongoing rights and responsibilities with respect to such Confidential Information.
10.4 MedImmune Confidential Information. With respect to any Confidential Information of PB that constitutes
MedImmune Confidential Information, SFJ hereby agrees to be bound by the provisions of Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.7 of the AZ
License to the same extent as PB is.
10.5 Confidential Status of the Agreement. Subject to Section 10.2 and Section 10.6, the terms of this Agreement,
including the form of Program Transfer Agreement (whether or not executed by the Parties), are deemed to be Confidential
Information and will be subject to the confidentiality requirements of this ARTICLE 10, with each Party being deemed a Receiving
Party for such purposes. The Parties each acknowledge that it will be necessary for PB to file this Agreement with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission and to make other required public disclosures regarding the terms of this Agreement, and
accordingly PB shall prepare a confidential treatment request in connection with such filing and provide SFJ a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such filing as well as on such other required public disclosures and thereafter use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain confidential treatment as to the terms of this Agreement.
10.6 Publicity. The Parties recognize that following the Effective Date the Parties (either individually or jointly) shall issue
mutually agreed press release(s) announcing the execution of this Agreement, and thereafter each Party may from time to time
desire to issue additional press releases and make other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, and hereby agree that such additional press releases, public statements and disclosures regarding the terms of this
Agreement will be permitted only with the other Party’s written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Any publication, news release or other public announcement relating to the terms of this Agreement will first be reviewed
and approved in writing by both Parties; provided, however, that any disclosure of the minimum information which is required by
Applicable Law (including the rules of a securities exchange), as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party’s counsel, may be
made without the prior consent of the other Party, although the other Party will be given prompt notice of any such legally required
disclosure and to the extent practicable will be provided an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure and the disclosing
Party will consider in
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020good faith any comments provided by the other Party on such proposed disclosure. For avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.6
shall not restrict PB from releasing public statements or disclosures regarding PB’s development and Commercialization activities
with respect to the Product.
10.7 Use of Name. Unless otherwise expressly permitted herein, PB will obtain the written consent of SFJ (which consent
will not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to referring to SFJ in any correspondence with any Regulatory
Authority or Governmental Authority, except as may be required by Applicable Law. SFJ agrees to be bound by Section 6.3 of
the AZ License to the same extent as PB is.

to sublicense through multiple tiers ((i) through (iii) in order of preference), to PB of any Trial Invention that such Third Party
contractor conceives, discovers, develops or otherwise makes in connection with activities conducted relating to this Agreement.

Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020SFJ Indemnified Party, or (ii) material breach of this Agreement, or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement by, SFJ.
12.2 Indemnification Procedure.
12.2.1 Notice of Claim. A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 12.1.1 or 12.1.2 (an
“Indemnified Party”) will give prompt written notice (each, an “Indemnification Claim Notice”) to the other Party (the
“Indemnifying Party”) upon receipt of notice of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought, or if
earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an
Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim of a Third Party as provided in this Section 12.2.1 will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Each Indemnification Claim Notice will contain a description of the Claim and
the nature and amount of the Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). The Indemnified
Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses.
12.2.2 Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Claim by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party’s receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The
assumption of the defense of a Claim by the Indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the Indemnifying
Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of
any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party’s claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, the
Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of such Claim.
12.2.3 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 12.2.2, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to (a)
participate in, but not control, the defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however,
that such engagement will be at the Indemnified Party’s own expense unless the engagement thereof has been specifically
authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, and (b) control its defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for
such purpose, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and engage
counsel in accordance with Section 12.2.2.
12.2.4 Settlement. With respect to any Losses related solely to payment of money damages in connection with a
Claim and that includes a complete and unconditional
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020release of the Indemnified Party, will not result in the Indemnified Party admitting liability, becoming subject to injunctive or other
equitable relief that will otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in any manner, and as to which the
Indemnifying Party will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnifying
Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss,
on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection
with Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Claim in accordance with Section 12.2.2, the
Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of
such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by the
Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the
Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
12.2.5 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the
Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and will furnish such records, information and
testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the
Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant
to such Claim, and making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.
12.3 Insurance.
12.3.1 Generally. Commencing as of the Effective Date and thereafter during the Development Term, and subject
to Section 12.3.2 below, each Party will carry and maintain, at its own expense, insurance coverage of the kind and with liability
limits that, at a minimum, satisfy the requirements of Section 12.3.2, to protect itself and the other Party against any claims or
liabilities that may arise from the conduct of the Clinical Trials and all other rights and obligations hereunder with insurers with a
minimum “A-” A.M. Best rating. Any deductibles for such insurance policies will be assumed by the insuring Party. Such insurance
policies will be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other similar insurance policies available to other Party and their
Affiliates. Prior to the Effective Date, and annually, at each anniversary of the Effective Date (unless, during such year, expiration of
the applicable policy occurs first, in which case, on such expiration date), at a Party’s written request the other Party will supply
documentation of such insurance coverage via original certificates of insurance, if applicable.
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020Each Party will provide the other Party a minimum of [***] prior written notice if it is unable to obtain appropriate insurance
coverage or if its coverage is canceled, unable to be renewed or materially changed. For clarity, any insurance coverage or the
failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage does not limit or reduce a Party’s liability under this Agreement. Each Party will
ensure that no subcontractor, including any Permitted Third Party, will continue to perform the work unless such subcontractor is
insured as deemed appropriate by the Party engaging the Permitted Third Party.
12.3.2 Minimum Requirements. Commencing as of the start of the Clinical Trials and thereafter, during the Term
(or longer if otherwise stated below), at a minimum, each Party will maintain the following types of insurance coverage at a
minimum level that is the greater of (a) the highest minimum level required by Applicable Law in the countries in which the Clinical
Trials and other obligations hereunder are being performed or (b) the following (to the extent different).
12.3.2.1 Commercial General Liability: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence; [***] dollars ($[***])
Product and Completed Operations aggregate, including Premises & Operations, Personal Injury, Product and Completed
Operations; [***] dollars ($[***]) combined single limit on all owned, non-owned and hired vehicles of such Party.
12.3.2.2 Umbrella Excess Liability: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence.
12.3.2.3 Clinical Trials Liability: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence. PB will obtain such Clinical Trials
Liability insurance on a global basis, and, if required, supplemented Clinical Trials Liability Insurance in the US, at its expense and
SFJ will obtain supplemental Clinical Trials Liability insurance for the SFJ Territory and on a country specific basis in the European
Clinical Trial Countries as required by Applicable Law at its expense, which will be considered Development Costs. Coverage
must be maintained for as long as required by Applicable Law in each country after release of the last Subject from the Clinical
Trials or where there is no legal requirement at least [***] after the termination of this Agreement.
12.3.2.4 Professional Liability: Any subcontractor, including any Permitted Third Party, who provides
professional services to such Party for the Clinical Trials, will obtain Professional Liability Insurance in lieu of Clinical Trial
Insurance, with a minimum limit of [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence. Coverage must be maintained for at least [***] after the
later of (i) expiration or early termination of this Agreement and (ii) release of the last Subject from the Clinical Trials.
12.3.3 Additional Insured. Each Party will include the other Party and its Affiliates as additional insured parties on
such Party’s Clinical Trial Liability insurance, as set forth in Section 12.3.2.3 for [***] after the later of termination of this
Agreement or release of the last Subject from the Clinical Trials.
12.3.4 Product Liability Insurance. Prior to a Program Transfer, PB will be responsible for maintaining product
liability insurance related to the Development and
Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020Commercialization of the Product at its expense with SFJ to be named as an additional insured party. From and after a Program
Transfer, SFJ will be responsible for maintaining product liability insurance related to the Development and Commercialization of
the Product at its expense with PB to be named as an additional insured party.

**********************************************************************************************
EXHIBIT A
A. PURPOSE OF APPLICATION SYSTEM.
To create a new iOS / Android Native app and a web responsive site to allow users to connect with each other inside a unique social betting
platform.
The Platform is social trivia, initially sports trivia and other trivia contests leading to peer to peer betting intended for the causal and non-
professional betting market.
A landing page to promote the product is included as well for desktop and mobile devices.
Developer will publish the app in Apple Store / Google Play Store with developer accounts registered to the client. The responsive website will be
uploaded and deployed into an AWS Environment also registered to the client.
The applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according API. The API will be open to be used in other
sports betting platforms.
The app will be developed under the following considerations:
● Native iOS Swift 5.0 Language with Xcode Development Environment.
● Native JAVA with Android Studio for Android Devices with OS 6.0+
● Ruby On Rails Backend + PostgreSQL + Rest API
● HTML5 + CSS 3 + Bootstrap
Core Platform
The Core of Click Stream is a free to play gaming platform that caters untapped market of the causal users that will spend a few seconds to interact
with a platform for free in order to win real money.
Our primary target is not the sports betters or the fantasy players. We target a more general demographic that is much more general and includes
more of the female population.
Our games will initially be quick to play quiz type games that allows the user to get involved in around 20 seconds, and then receive results from
push notifications. Game types are set up dynamically with live game shows with Hosts 2 – 4 times per month. Because the format doesn’t change,
we can run games nightly for NBA to NHL, NFL to individual events such as the Oscars, other awards shows, and new sporting events such as
Soccer and Nascar.
Games and events automated from the backend and launched automatically. Api’s Are plugged in to track results in real time, and there is a manual
option to allow customs events that can be run through the platform.
Business model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant
amounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of a few dollars. Our winners are
more top loaded and pay out around $2,500 per the top 5 and $1,000 per the top 10.
Initially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around $25,000 to the winners and Sponsors
will pay around $30,000 to $35,000 to sponsor the event. In return they will get around 30,000-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their
product/company.
8 │ Page
Source: CLICKSTREAM CORP, 1-A, 3/30/2020Eventually the platform will expand into affiliate sales of products and once the audience has grown large enough, peer to peer betting.
Monetization
We will initially fund the first month of pots in order to attract enough users to get sponsors. After the first month we will have enough users to
begin having sponsors pay the pots. We will then expand to peer to peer betting and advertising.
B. SERVICES.
The Developer will develop the mobile application based on the Client’s specifications, will assist the Client in acquiring corporate sponsors and
will operate and maintain the Application System through hosting of games including customer support. The Client will provide The Developer

to purchase stock, or an arrangement involving a division of profits or special rebates or allowances) without which
agreement, understanding, or arrangement, prices paid by such a corporation, firm, association or individual for the Licensed
Products would be higher than the Net Sales Price reported by Eutectix, or if such agreement, understanding, or arrangement
results in extending to such corporation, firm, association, or individual lower prices for Licensed Products than those
charged to outside concerns buying similar products in similar amounts and under similar conditions, then, and in any such
events, the royalties to be paid hereunder in respect of such Licensed Products shall be computed based on an assumed or
deemed Net Sales Price equal to those charged to such outside concerns.
2.9 Commission. From time to time, Liquidmetal may encounter, develop, and refer to Eutectix customer accounts for direct sales
by Eutectix. Provided that such referred customer is not already a Eutectix customer, Eutectix may accept such customer
referral, and in that case hereby agrees to pay Liquidmetal a cash commission based on a percentage of the invoice price of
Licensed Products sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix, in
addition to the Liquidmetal Royalty. The cash commission shall be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Net Sales
Price of the invoice price of Licensed Products sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was
actually received by Eutectix (the “ Liquidmetal Commission”). The Liquidmetal Commission shall be paid in U.S. dollars
within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, based on payments received for sales of Licensed Products made during
a given quarter. Liquidmetal hereby waives the payment of any Liquidmetal Commission otherwise due and payable pursuant

14.1. Notice
Either Party shall give notice to the other Party of any actual or suspected infringement of the Intellectual Property or the

If Eurofarma has not made the first commercial sale within twelve (12) months after receipt of the MA in a Lead Country of the
Territory, not for reasons outside of its control, or if Eurofarma has failed to use reasonable commercial efforts to meet the annual
objectives of the most updated Business Plan during the Term, which may be amended by Eurofarma from time to time and

do not allow the Licensed Product to be approved by the US FDA.

economic conditions, outside of the Parties control, at the time of the launch of the Licensed Product in the territory

This Agreement is made as of the Effective Date between:
ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company , a corporation of the State of Delaware having offices at 1545 Route 22 East,
Annandale, New Jersey 08801 (“ExxonMobil ”); and
FuelCell Energy, Inc., a corporation of the State of Delaware having offices at 3 Great Pasture Road, Danbury, Connecticut 06810
(“FCE”).
ExxonMobil and FCE are engaged in collaborative research and development projects to evaluate and develop Molten Carbonate Fuel
Cells (MCFCs) to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (i.e., achieve low cost carbon dioxide capture). ExxonMobil and FCE wish to
further the research and development efforts to evaluate and develop new and/or improved MCFCs to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions from industrial and power sources (“Scope”). Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises and mutual covenants
contained herein, ExxonMobil and FCE (each a “Party” and collectively the “Parties”) agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS
1.01 Definitions. The terms appearing in this Agreement in initial capital letters, not otherwise defined in the preamble or body
of this Agreement, are defined in Appendix A.
ARTICLE 2 - PROGRAM
2.01 Program / Projects. The collaborative research and development effort will comprise one or more mutually agreed upon
projects within the Scope during the Term of this Agreement (each a “Project” and, collectively, the “Projects” or the
“Program”). The details of each Project will be described in a written, mutually agreed upon document (“Project
Description”) - a template for which is set forth in Appendix B. Each Project Description will specify the scope and content
of the Project, the work to be undertaken by each Party and potential third parties, the deliverables, the timing, any
payments to be made not otherwise set forth in this Agreement, and any other related objectives and expectations. When
completed and signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties, each Project Description will become part of this
Agreement and will be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Neither Party makes any representations
as to the number, frequency, or monetary value of the Projects, except as otherwise set forth herein or in any Project
Description.
2.02 Subcontracting. ExxonMobil hereby consents to FCE hiring trade contractors commonly used for facility modifications
and individual engineering contractors and individual staff from temporary agencies as needed to perform work pursuant to
a Project Description, provided that such contractors and staff are under confidentiality and use restrictions no less
restrictive than the terms and conditions set forth herein.
2.03 Work Exclusivity/Independent Work . During the Term of this Agreement, FCE will not conduct any Work using
Generation 1 Technology in Carbon Capture Applications or any Work using Generation 2 Technology, independently or
with third parties outside this Agreement, without prior written approval from ExxonMobil. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
ExxonMobil hereby grants approval for FCE solely to conduct Authorized Work using Generation 1 Technology with
Authorized Third Parties for Carbon Capture Applications and any Work using Generation 2 Technology solely for Power
Applications and Hydrogen Applications.

3.01 Steering Committee . Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties will establish a committee that will oversee technical
support and provide overall supervision and administrative guidance for the Program (“Steering Committee” or “SC”),
further detailed as follows -
(a) Composition. Each Party will appoint in writing one or more of its employees as SC members. Each Party will
have the right to change its SC members at any time by giving written notice of such change to the other Party.
(b) Meetings. Meetings of the SC will be in person or by phone at a location and time agreed to in advance by the
SC members.
(c) Other Attendees. In addition to the attendance of SC members, with prior written notice to the other Party’s SC
members, each Party may also bring to any SC meeting such technical and other advisors as it may deem
appropriate, provided that such advisors are employees of a Party or its Affiliates and are under written
confidentiality and use restrictions at least as strict as those imposed herein. Otherwise, a Party’s additional
invitees may attend a SC meeting only with the other Party’s advance written approval.
(d) Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the SC will include, but are not limited to:
i. Project Endorsement and Monitoring . The SC will review and approve each Project Description and
amendment thereto prior to execution by the Parties. (However, no Project Description or amendment
thereto will be effective unless and until it is executed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties.)
The SC will periodically monitor the ongoing status of all Projects, and make adjustments to priorities within
and between the Projects.
ii. Dispute Resolution . Assist the Parties in resolving any disputes.
(e) Votes. Each Party only gets one vote on the SC regardless of the number of SC members it appoints. Except as
otherwise stated in this Agreement, all decisions by the SC will be by unanimous agreement. In the absence of
unanimity, ExxonMobil’s SC representatives will have final decision making authority with respect to only the
following decisions required by the SC: whether and where to seek patent protection and whether to maintain
patent assets, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6.04 (Solicitation of Program Patents Discretionary).

the last two (2) months of the Term of the Agreement. When FCE issues the invoice during the last month
of the Term of the Agreement (“8th Inning Invoice”), FCE will apply some or all of the Initial Payment, as
applicable, as credit against the amount due.
ii. Within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Term of the Agreement, FCE will issue an invoice (“9th Inning
Invoice”) for the actual charges incurred during the last month of the Term of the Agreement, subject to
Paragraph 10.01(a). FCE will apply any balance of the Initial Payment remaining after the 8 th Inning
Invoice as a credit towards the amount due on the 9th Inning Invoice. If after applying such credit, a balance
of the Initial Payment still remains, FCE will refund the balance to ExxonMobil within thirty (30) days, unless
otherwise mutually agreed (such as the Parties mutually agreeing to enter into a new Project and apply the
balance as a credit towards amounts payable by ExxonMobil thereunder).
e) Maximum Charges. The invoices sent by FCE under the foregoing procedure for each year of the Agreement
may not in the aggregate be more than half the Total Research Cost, without prior written consent of ExxonMobil
or amendment to the Project Description. All such payments will be made after ExxonMobil’s receipt of invoice
in accordance with the invoicing procedures specified Paragraph 10.04 (Invoices).
10.02 Up-Front Exclusivity and Technology Access Payment . In exchange for FCE working exclusively with ExxonMobil
during the Term of the Agreement, pursuant to Paragraph 2.03 (Work Exclusivity/Independent Work), and ExxonMobil’s
access to FCE Background Patents, pursuant to Paragraph 8.02(a) (Grant of Rights to Background Information and
Background Patents), on the Effective Date, FCE will separately invoice, and ExxonMobil will pay a one-time up-front fee
(“Exclusivity and Technology Access Fee”) of five million United States dollars ($5,000,000 USD).
Such payment will be made within fifteen (15) days after ExxonMobil’s receipt of invoice, notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, including Paragraph 10.04 (Invoices).
10.03 Milestone Payments. As further consideration for technical progress in the Program, ExxonMobil shall pay the following
sums upon achievement of the following Program milestones (“Milestone Payments”):
(a) ExxonMobil will pay FCE a first Milestone Payment of five million United States dollars ($5,000,000 USD) upon
FCE achieving Milestone 1 to ExxonMobil’s satisfaction; and
(b) ExxonMobil will pay FCE a second and final Milestone Payment of five million United States dollars ($5,000,000
USD), upon FCE achieving Milestone 2 to ExxonMobil’s satisfaction.
All such Milestone Payments will be made after ExxonMobil’s receipt of invoice in accordance with the invoicing
procedures specified Paragraph 10.04 (Invoices). The obligation to pay any such installment ends upon termination of this
Agreement by either Party for any reason prior to FCE achieving the respective milestone.

4.1. Price. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Products shall be established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other
than Reagent Kits. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Reagent Kits Products shall be based upon a formula intended to ensure
that Sekisui will receive 90% of the total Available Margin for all Products during the first 12 months of this Agreement, 70% of the
total Available Margin for all Products during months 13-24 of this Agreement, and 65% of the total Available Margin for all Products
thereafter. Accordingly, the prices (established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits) to be
paid by Sekisui for the Products shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up) for each respective prospective six month period in
the manner set forth in Exhibit D. The initial prices Sekisui agrees to pay for the respective Products for the first such prospective “six
month period” (in this instance actually a five month period: May-September 2016) shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up)
in the manner set forth in Exhibit D. Thereafter such prices shall be revisited and recalculated (prospectively) every six months in the
manner set forth in Exhibit D (i.e., for purposes of such calculations for establishing the new prospective prices for the reagent
products, the applicable Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin shall be the Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin for the
applicable historical 6-month period as defined in Exhibit D). In addition, on a semi-annual basis, such amount shall be reviewed based
on the actual Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin for the 6 months then ended. In the event that such review results in a
difference from the intended share of Available Margin between the Parties as contemplated above, the Parties shall make a true up
payment between them in order to compensate for such overpayment or shortfall, all as provided in Exhibit D. Any true-up payments
shall be paid by the applicable Party within 30 days of the receipt of an invoice for the agreed to true up amount.
Sekisui shall set the customer selling prices in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
4.2. Shipment. The shipment of orders to Sekisui’s customers shall be subject to the ability of Sekisui and Qualigen to obtain all required

such as providing original or proprietary documents, submitting free product samples or extensive translations. All Product ordered
by Sekisui’s customers shall be suitably packed for shipment and storage by Qualigen on behalf of Sekisui in accordance with
Qualigen’s standard commercial shipping practices. Each order shall be shipped as designated by Sekisui’s customers in the order. If
the carrier noted on the Sekisui customer’s purchase order is not available, or if the purchase order does not designate a carrier, then
Sekisui shall select the mode of shipment or, if Sekisui does not select the mode of shipment, Qualigen shall select the mode of
shipment. Qualigen’s responsibility shall be to deposit the ordered goods with the designated carrier within the shipping periods
specified, and Qualigen shall not be liable for late delivery if so accomplished.

expenses.
4.5. Financing Payments; Development Plan . In addition to the payments for the purchase of Products set forth in Section 4.1 above, in

and directly supported by factual materials provided by Qualigen to Sekisui. Sekisui shall not make any false or misleading
representations to customers or others regarding Qualigen or the Products. Sekisui shall not make any representations, warranties or
guarantees with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the Products that are not contained within Qualigen’s
documentation accompanying the Products or Qualigen’s literature describing the Products, including Qualigen’s standard limited
warranty and disclaimers.

Products, but in the event that such sales taxes are applicable and Qualigen has the legal obligation to collect such sales taxes (or are
sales taxes imposed on a seller), Qualigen shall be entitled to add to its invoice the amount of such sales taxes and Sekisui shall pay
such amount unless Sekisui provides Qualigen with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. As
between the Parties, all customs duties shall be the responsibility of Sekisui, and all duty expenses will be included as an element of
COGS as referenced in Exhibit A and will be included as part of the Actual Margin True-Up as defined in Exhibit D. The parties agree
to cooperate with one another and use reasonable efforts to avoid or reduce tax withholding or similar obligations in respect of
Financing Payments, Product purchase payments, and other payments made by Sekisui to Qualigen under this Agreement. To the
extent Sekisui is required to withhold taxes on any payment to Qualigen, Sekisui shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper
governmental authority in a timely manner and promptly transmit to Qualigen evidence of such payment and/or an official tax
certificate, or such other evidence as Qualigen may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid. Qualigen shall
provide Sekisui any tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for Sekisui to not withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced
rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. Each Party shall provide the other with reasonable assistance to enable the
recovery, as permitted by applicable law, of withholding taxes, value added taxes, or similar obligations resulting from payments made
under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of the Party bearing such withholding tax or value added tax.
4.9.1. Medical Device Tax. The party responsible for paying any applicable medical device excise tax pursuant to Section 4191 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any successor thereto will be as determined under such tax provisions. If any, such medical device
excise tax will be treated as a cost element to be included in COGS as referenced in Exhibit A.
4.10. Interest . Accrual and payment of interest shall not be deemed to excuse or cure breaches of contract arising from late payment or
nonpayment. Cumulative with and not exclusive of any and all other available remedies, payments that are more than 30 days past due
hereunder, and which are not otherwise subject to a good faith dispute, shall accrue interest, from the due date until paid, at an annual

manufacturing processes, Qualigen will certify that, to the best of its knowledge, each of the Products identified in any certification is
in compliance with the substance restrictions of REACH and RoHS or is exempt from REACH and RoHS, unless Qualigen has advised
Sekisui in advance that any Product or any material incorporated into, or used to produce, any Product (“ Material”) do not comply

consult Sekisui before determining not to pursue in any Applicable Market any particular Intellectual Property Rights related to any
product development efforts covered by the Development Plan. In the event that Qualigen elects not to prosecute or maintain in a
particular Applicable Market country any Patent Rights in the jointly developed Development IP (the “ Abandoned Joint IP”), Sekisui
may elect to prosecute such Abandoned Joint IP in such particular Applicable Market country, in which case the Patent Rights for
such Abandoned Joint IP in such particular in Applicable Market country shall be owned solely by Sekisui.

name or trademark of the other Party in existence during the Term (nor any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark confusingly

9. Sale Transaction
9.1. Exclusivity Period. The parties anticipate that they will entertain a potential acquisition of Qualigen by Sekisui during 2018 on terms to
be mutually agreed. Accordingly, Qualigen hereby agrees that during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall not, directly or indirectly,
through its affiliates, agents, stockholders, officers, directors or otherwise solicit, initiate, participate in discussions or negotiations or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or provide any information to any person, entity or group other than Sekisui concerning a Sale
Transaction. In the event that Qualigen nonetheless receives an unsolicited offer to engage in a Sale Transaction during such
Exclusivity Period, Qualigen may engage with such party to the extent legally required to comply with its fiduciary duties, so long as
Qualigen (i) promptly communicates to Sekisui the material terms of any proposal or offer or request for information which it may
receive in respect of any such proposed Sale Transaction, including the purchase price, form and timing of consideration and the
identity of the acquirer, and (ii) complies with Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal (as defined below).
9.2. Negotiation Period. No later than July 1, 2018 (and sooner upon Sekisui’s written request at any time before July 1, 2018), the parties
shall engage in good faith negotiations for a period of up to 6 months (the “ Negotiation Period ”) with respect to a potential
acquisition by Sekisui of Qualigen. During the Negotiation Period, Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui all due diligence information
reasonably requested by Sekisui so that it may make an informed offer to acquire Qualigen. Any Financing Payments made by Sekisui
will be credited against any such Sale Transaction agreed to between Sekisui and Qualigen. If the parties do not mutually agree to the
terms of such potential acquisition within the Negotiation Period then the Exclusivity Period shall end and, subject to Sekisui’s Right
of First Refusal, Qualigen shall be free to negotiate the terms of a Sale Transaction with any Third Party.
9.3. Right of First Refusal . During the Term, Sekisui shall have a right of first refusal to match the terms of any arms length, bona fide
proposed Sale Transaction with a Third Party (“ Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal”). Qualigen shall provide Sekisui with at least 30 days
prior written notice and access to all due diligence materials provided to any potential acquirer, such 30 day period to commence upon
the notification to Sekisui that Qualigen’s board of directors has approved such Proposed Sale Transaction (as set forth in a term
sheet or draft definitive agreement provided to Sekisui), subject to Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal. At any time during such 30 day
period, Sekisui may elect to match the terms of such proposal. Sekisui will be credited in any such proposal by the cumulative amount
of all Financing Payments made to date. For example, if a Third Party offers to acquire Qualigen for $50,000,000 and Sekisui has funded
the full $6,200,000 of Financing Payments, Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal to match the proposed transaction would be a price of
$43,800,000. In the event that Sekisui elects not to move forward with such proposal for a Sale Transaction, Qualigen shall have a
period of 120 days to consummate a Sale Transaction on the same terms as provided to Sekisui. If a Sale Transaction has not been
consummated within such 120 days period, any Sale Transaction must once again comply with the provisions of this Section 9.3.

Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/20209.4. Penalty for Breach. In the event of any breach of Sections 9.1 through 9.3, including without limitation, any actions by stockholders of
Qualigen that result in a Sale Transaction without complying with Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, or otherwise hinder the intent and
purpose of the provisions of Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, in addition to any other remedies available to Sekisui under the terms of
this Agreement, including the right to specific performance and other equitable remedies, Sekisui shall be entitled to liquidated
damages in the amount of three times any and all Financing Payments made to date. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does not
apply to a failure of the stockholders of Qualigen to approve a Sale Transaction proposed by Sekisui, so long as such stockholders
did not approve a Sale Transaction on the same terms with a Third Party during the Term.
9.5. Molecular Clinical Diagnostics. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall, in consultation with
Sekisui, take commercially reasonable steps to seek to regain any rights in any Qualigen molecular clinical diagnostic product
technology that Qualigen has previously granted to Gen-Probe, Hologic, or any of their affiliates.
10. Representations and Warranties
10.1. By Qualigen. Qualigen hereby represents, warrants and covenants that:

the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui’s
customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the “User Warranty”). The User
Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover
Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were
subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress.
10.2. By Sekisui. Sekisui represents, warrants and covenants that:
(a) Sekisui has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to make the promises set
forth in this Agreement and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the
provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Sekisui.
(b) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui’s best
knowledge, any patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to Sekisui’s sale
or distribution of the Products.

Qualigen).
11. Indemnities
11.1. Indemnification by Sekisui. Sekisui shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Qualigen, and its directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives (collectively, the “ Qualigen Indemnitees ”) from and against any and all claims, suits and proceedings by a Third
Party (individually and collectively, “ Claims”), and any and all losses, obligations, damages, deficiencies, costs, penalties, liabilities,
assessments, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines and expenses (including court costs and reasonable fees and expenses of
attorneys), incurred in the investigation, defense and/or settlement of any Claims (individually and collectively, “ Losses ”; it being
expressly understood, however, that incidental, special, indirect and consequential damages and lost profits, lost savings and
interruptions of business are expressly excluded therefrom and from such defined term): (a) arising out of the negligence or willful
misconduct of Sekisui or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives in the performance of Sekisui’s obligations under
this Agreement; or (b) arising out of or in connection with a breach or violation by Sekisui or its subdistributor of any applicable law
or a material breach by Sekisui of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth
herein; provided , however, that Sekisui shall have no liability or obligation to any Qualigen Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to
the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Qualigen Indemnitee’s breach of applicable law, breach of this
Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct.
11.2. Indemnification by Qualigen. Qualigen shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sekisui and its directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives (collectively, the “ Sekisui Indemnitees ”) from and against any and all Losses incurred in the investigation,

accordance with Qualigen’s guidelines and has not been used after its expiration date or subjected to abuse, mishandling or unusual
physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress; (b) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Qualigen or its directors,

patent, proprietary, or intellectual property right of any Third Party in the Territory; provided , however, that Qualigen shall have no
liability or obligation to any Sekisui Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused
by a Sekisui Indemnitee’s (or any other entity or person within the Sekisui corporate family’s) breach of applicable law, breach of this
Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct.

Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/202011.3. Patent Indemnity. Qualigen and Sekisui shall notify each other promptly in writing of any action (and all prior claims relating to such
action) brought against Qualigen or Sekisui alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product
constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, and (provided that such a Claim does not arise from
Sekisui’s noncompliance with Sections 3.6, 8.4, 10.2(b), 10.2(c), 10.2(e) or 10.2(f) of this Agreement (e.g., Sekisui has altered a Product
or has used a Sekisui trademark in connection with a Product)) Qualigen agrees to defend Sekisui in such action at its expense and
shall pay any costs or damages finally awarded against Sekisui in any such action; provided, that Qualigen shall have had sole
control of the defense of any such action and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise and provided further that no settlement
or compromise shall be binding on a Party hereto without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
In the event a lawsuit is filed against Sekisui or Qualigen alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of
a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, or Qualigen files an action for declaratory
judgment because of a serious threat of such a lawsuit, or if in Qualigen’s reasonable business judgment a Product is likely to become
the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent or other intellectual property right; then Qualigen may, at its expense, and may
request Sekisui’s assistance to, attempt to obtain a license to such patent or other intellectual property right.
11.4. Indemnification Procedures . The Party or other Indemnitee intending to claim indemnification under this Section 11 (an “ Indemnified
Party”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “ Indemnifying Party”) of any Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party intends
to claim such indemnification (provided, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice directly caused by the delay or other deficiency), and the Indemnifying Party shall
assume the defense thereof (with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party)
whether or not such Claim is rightfully brought; provided, however , that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel and participate in the defense thereof, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party, unless the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense or unless a representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding
the previous sentence, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be required to pay for more than one separate counsel no matter the
number or circumstances of all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to timely assume the defense of and reasonably
defend such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain or assume control of such defense and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay (as incurred and on demand) the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party and all other expenses of
investigation and litigation. The Indemnified Party, and its directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigations of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for the indemnification of any Claim settled (or resolved by consent to the entry of judgment) without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. Also, if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to settle such Claim; provided , that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of (or resolving by consent to the
entry of judgment upon) such Claim unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of
any person or entity by an Indemnified Party, no requirement that the Indemnified Party admit fault or culpability, and no adverse
effect on any other claims that may be made by or against the Indemnified Party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such settlement does not require the Indemnified Party to take (or refrain from
taking) any action.
17
Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020Regardless of who controls the defense, the other Party hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense as may be requested.
Without limitation, the Party hereto which is not the Indemnifying Party and (if different) the Indemnified Party, and their respective
directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in
the investigation and defense of any Claim.
11.5. Expenses of Enforcement. As the Parties intend complete indemnification, all costs and expenses of enforcing any provision of this
Section 11 shall also be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party except as otherwise set forth in Section 11.4.
11.6. Insurance . Qualigen, at its own expense, shall procure and maintain during the Term, insurance policies with the minimum coverages
set forth below (“Insurance ”). Sekisui shall be named as an additional insured with respect to the Insurance. The Insurance shall be
primary for all purposes to other insurance coverage, whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess,
contingent or otherwise, without recourse to or contribution from any Sekisui-owned coverage.
(a) Commercial General Liability Insurance  - Combined single limit for bodily and property damage of not less than $1,000,000 for each
occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate providing:
● Assault and Battery coverage,
● Broad form property damage coverage,

● Products and completed operations coverage, and
● Personal and advertising injury coverage.
(b) Workers’ Compensation and Employer’s Liability Insurance  - With limits of liability for:

● Employer’s liability for bodily injury by accident: $500,000 each accident; bodily injury by disease: $500,000 policy limit; and
bodily injury by disease: $500,000 each employee.
All Qualigen’s Insurance shall be placed with an insurer that (a) has an A.M. Best rating of A- or better or (b) is a qualified self-
insurance program that is approved by Sekisui. Qualigen shall provide Sekisui, upon request, with written evidence of the Insurance,
including where it is provided through qualified self-insurance. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit Qualigen’s
responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of Qualigen’s insurance policies.
12. Regulatory Matters
12.1. Regulatory Approval . Qualigen shall be responsible for maintaining, at its sole cost, the Regulatory Approvals required for the
marketing and sale of the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals required for
the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in
good standing all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other
as may be necessary to maintain required Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisui’s commercially reasonable request.
18
Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/202012.2. Distribution Approvals . Sekisui shall be responsible for seeking, obtaining and maintaining (i) all licenses, registrations and permits
(excluding patents) required to be obtained by Sekisui to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product pursuant to this
Agreement, and (ii) all approvals from the Regulatory Authorities regarding marketing and advertising materials to be used by Sekisui
to promote the Product. Qualigen shall cooperate with Sekisui in making and maintaining all filings that may be necessary or desirable
in connection with obtaining and maintaining any regulatory approvals necessary for Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product in
the Applicable Markets.
12.3. Communication With Agencies . In the Applicable Markets, Qualigen shall have responsibility for communications with the
Regulatory Authorities concerning any required Regulatory Approvals, approval of Product related marketing and advertising
materials, and Product quality matters.
12.4. Governmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any
warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or
local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the
manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.
12.5. Adverse Events, Recalls and Field Corrections . Qualigen shall have responsibility to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls
or Field Corrections information must be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities and
Qualigen shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to
respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen shall provide prompt notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or
Field Corrections, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from Qualigen learning of such
occurrence.
12.6. Complaints. Qualigen shall receive, investigate in a timely manner, and as appropriate, resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If
an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and
shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation
results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a
Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer.  (Provided, that if a
request for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the
product, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen
shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the
expiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint.

Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/202012.7. Product Recalls. In the event that (i) any Applicable Market governmental agency or authority issues a request or directive or orders
that the Products be recalled or retrieved, (ii) an Applicable Market court of competent jurisdiction orders that the Products be
recalled or retrieved, or (iii) Qualigen and Sekisui reasonably determine, after mutual consultation, that the Products should be
recalled, corrected or retrieved in any particular country or countries, Qualigen and/or Sekisui shall conduct such activity and the
parties shall take all appropriate corrective actions and shall execute the steps detailed in the recall strategy. Qualigen shall be
responsible for the content of any communication to the customers regarding any Recall or Field Correction. In the event such action
results from Sekisui’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, Sekisui shall be responsible for the expenses thereof. Otherwise,
Qualigen shall be responsible for the expenses of the action. Sekisui and Qualigen shall cooperate fully with one another in
conducting any such action. Sekisui shall destroy units of Products lawfully recalled only upon Qualigen’s (or any governmental
authority’s) written instruction to destroy such units of Products, and only then in accordance with Qualigen’s procedures and
instructions. Otherwise, Sekisui shall return the recalled units of Product to Qualigen in accordance with Qualigen’s procedures and
instructions after completion of the action.
12.8. European Union Vigilance and Canada Mandatory Problem Reporting . In the event that Qualigen receives any Potentially Serious
Complaints regarding the Products from a customer located in the European Union or Canada, then Qualigen shall notify Sekisui
promptly, but in any event within no more than (3) business days. If Qualigen receives a complaint from any Competent Authority or
Health Canada with regard to the Products, Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than 48 hours.
Qualigen shall have the responsibility to correspond with the Competent Authority or Health Canada, as the Authorized
Representative or Regulatory Correspondent, regarding any such complaints. If corrective actions are required, the cost of the
corrective action shall be borne by Qualigen up to the extent such complaint is related to the manufacturing of the Products by
Qualigen, or some other cause or event attributable to Qualigen, and shall be borne by Sekisui up to the extent such complaint is due
to some other cause or event attributable to Sekisui.

13.1. Confidentiality Obligation. It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to
time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (“ Confidential Information ”). Except to the extent expressly
authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the
expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information only to its
own (or its Affiliates’) officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers,
lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their
respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in
accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to
the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither
Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other’s prior written consent. In all events,
however, any and all disclosure to a Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure/nonuse
agreement no less restrictive than this Section 13 (or, in the case of attorneys, to a duty and obligation of nondisclosure/nonuse
pursuant to the applicable rules of the profession). The Party which disclosed Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party
(or to any such Affiliate) shall be responsible and liable for any disclosure or use by such Third Party or Affiliate (or its disclosees)
which would have violated this Agreement if committed by the Party itself. Neither Party shall use Confidential Information of the
other except as expressly allowed by and for the purposes of this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under
this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit) or and, after the
Term, by Qualigen only to the extent required to continue to offer and provide goods and services to former Sekisui customers of
Products. Each Party shall take such action to preserve the confidentiality of each other’s Confidential Information as it would
customarily take to preserve the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information (but in no event less than a reasonable standard of
care). Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party, upon the other’s request, promptly shall return or destroy all the
Confidential Information disclosed to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, including all copies, reflections, analyses and
extracts of documents, except for one archival copy (and such electronic copies that exist as part of the Party’s computer systems,
network storage systems and electronic backup systems) of such materials solely to be able to monitor its obligations that survive
under this Agreement. The non-use and non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall not apply to any Confidential
Information, or portion thereof, that the receiving Party can demonstrate:
(a) is at the time of disclosure in the public domain;
21
Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020(b) after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no fault of and or without violation
of any duty of confidentiality of the receiving Party or its disclosees;
(c) at the time of disclosure is already in the receiving Party’s possession with no duty of confidentiality, and such prior
possession can be demonstrated by the receiving Party by written proof (provided that this subsection shall not apply to
Confidential Information exchanged between the Parties before the execution of this Agreement that was subject to a
confidentiality obligation at the time of such disclosure);
(d) is rightfully received by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from an independent Third Party without obligation
of confidentiality; provided, however, that to the receiving Party’s best knowledge, such information was not obtained by
said Third Party, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing Party; or
(e) is independently developed by or expressly for the receiving Party, in either case solely by personnel without any access to
or use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as shown by receiving Party’s contemporaneous written records.
In the event either Party must disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information in order to comply with applicable governmental
regulations or as otherwise required by law or judicial process, such Party shall give reasonable advance notice to the other Party of
such proposed disclosure in order that the non-disclosing Party may intercede and oppose such process, and shall use its best
efforts to secure a protective order or confidential-treatment order preventing or limiting (to the greatest possible extent and for the
longest possible period) the disclosure and/or requiring that the Confidential Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes
for which the law or regulation required, or for which the order was issued.
The Parties acknowledge that the defined term “Confidential Information” shall include not only a disclosing Party’s own Confidential
Information but also Confidential Information of an Affiliate or of a Third Party which is in the possession of a disclosing Party.
However, both Parties agree not to disclose to the other Party any Confidential Information of a Third Party which is in the
possession of such Party, unless the other Party has given an express prior written consent (which specifies the owner of such
Confidential Information) to receive such particular Confidential Information.

Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either Sekisui or Qualigen
from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the
Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other
disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the
prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Party’s legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are
not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures.
13.2. Use of Names . During the Term, Sekisui is hereby permitted to use the Qualigen name and any Qualigen content (including the
content of any existing sales collateral and marketing materials) in any sales collateral, marketing materials or other communications
used in connection with the marketing and sales of the Product with the prior written consent of Qualigen, which consent shall not be
reasonably withheld or delayed. Other than as provided in the foregoing sentence or to the extent such use is based on a public
disclosure previously made by the other Party, during the Term neither Qualigen nor Sekisui shall use the name of the other in any
verbal or written communications with any Third Party, except as allowed or contemplated herein, without the prior written consent of
the other Party.
13.3. Press Releases. Neither Party shall make any press release or other similar public announcement concerning this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event such disclosure or public announcement is required to be made on a more immediate basis to comply with applicable laws, then
approval will be deemed granted if no response is received from the non-disclosing Party within the time frames required by law;
provided, however, that the disclosing Party provides the non-disclosing Party with notice of the legally required time frame for the
approval of the disclosure. Neither Party shall use the trademark or logo of the other Party, its Affiliates or their respective
employee(s) in any publicity, promotion, news release or public disclosure relating to this Agreement or its subject matter, except as
may be required by law or except with the prior express written permission of such other Party, such permission not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, or except in Sekisui’s advertisement, promotion and sale of the Products in compliance with this
Agreement in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the above, once a public disclosure has been made, either Party shall
be free to disclose to Third Parties any information contained in said public disclosure, without further pre-review or pre-approval.
13.4. Audit Rights. Each Party shall keep accurate books and records in sufficient detail to comply with applicable laws, rules and
regulations and this Agreement and enable the other Party to determine the correctness of any report made under this Agreement and
monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement through the process below. Upon reasonable
written notice (and no more often than once every 150 days), the auditing Party shall have the right, during normal business hours, to
audit the books and records maintained by the audited Party pursuant to this Agreement to ensure the accuracy of all reports and
payments made hereunder.

14.1. Termination by Either Party. Either Party may terminate this Agreement (i) immediately upon written notice in the event of the closing
of a Sale Transaction; or (ii) immediately upon written notice if the other files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or makes a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes subject to any order for relief or involuntary bankruptcy petition under any
bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or similar law which is not dismissed within 60 days.
14.2. Termination by Qualigen . Qualigen may terminate this Agreement (i) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event of any
failure of Sekisui to make a Financing Payment that is determined to be due, which failure is not cured within such 30 day period, or (ii)
upon sixty (60) days prior written notice in the event of any material breach of the diligence obligations (which is understood not to
include failing to meet forecasts for sales to customers) set forth in the Business Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time
to time), which breach is not cured within such 60 day period.
14.3. Termination by Sekisui. Sekisui may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice (i) in the event of any failure of Qualigen to
meet a milestone set forth in the Development Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), or (ii) at any other time
upon ninety (90) days’ prior written notice of impending termination.
14.4. Effect of Termination. Sections 4.6, 5.5, 8.1, 8.2, 11.1-11.4, 13, 14.4 and 15 shall survive the later of the expiration or termination of the
Term. In addition, all provisions that survive termination, that are irrevocable or that arise due to termination shall survive in
accordance with their terms. Any other provisions of this Agreement contemplated by their terms to pertain to a period of time
following termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive only for the specified period of time. Upon the expiration or
termination of the Term, (i) Sekisui shall cooperate in permitting Qualigen to offer to rehire any Sekisui sales representatives who are
primarily responsible for selling the Products as set forth in Section 4.6, (ii) Sekisui shall transfer to Qualigen the ownership of any
Sekisui Instruments (subject to reimbursement from Qualigen for the book value (original cost less depreciation) of such Sekisui
Instruments), (iii) Qualigen shall reimburse Sekisui for a prorated portion of all prepaid distribution fees paid by Sekisui during the
final year of this Agreement to subdistributors, (iv) Sekisui shall assign to Qualigen each subdistributor agreement which Qualigen
requests be assigned to Qualigen, and (v) each Party shall remain liable for its obligations accrued before the effective date of such
expiration or termination (and for avoidance of doubt: upon expiration or termination Sekisui shall remain liable to pay Qualigen all
Financing Payments then due under the Development Plan based upon the milestones that Qualigen has completed by the date of
such expiration or termination). In the event there are unfulfilled orders for Products outstanding as of termination of this Agreement,
Sekisui may, at its option, cancel such orders upon notice to Qualigen (in which case Qualigen agrees to fill such orders to Sekisui’s
end customers directly unless such customer chooses to cancel such order) or cause Qualigen to fulfill such orders and invoice
Sekisui for amounts owed with respect thereto. If either Party is aware of an impending expiration or termination of the Term, it shall
conduct its business with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement in the ordinary course (and not otherwise than in the
ordinary course) for the duration of the Term.

15.1. Independent Contractor. For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor
and not an agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of the other Party. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements,
representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be
explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so.
15.2. Assignment . The Agreement shall not be assigned and is not assignable or delegable by either Party without the written consent of
the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that Sekisui and Qualigen each may assign this Agreement
without the consent of the other to a successor in connection with the merger, consolidation or sale of such Party or of all or
substantially all of its assets or the portion of its business to which this Agreement relates.
15.3. No Waiver. Failure of either Party to enforce (or reasonable delay in enforcing) a right under this Agreement shall not act as a waiver
of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved or to terminate this Agreement arising
out of any subsequent default or breach. A waiver by a Party of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in any instance
shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any other term or condition hereof.
15.4. Severability. This Agreement is divisible and separable. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a final and binding court
judgment (for which no further appeal is possible) to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be not
affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any way; and the affected provision shall (if at all
possible) be construed as if it had been written in such a way as to both be valid, legal and enforceable and to achieve, to the greatest
lawful extent, the evident economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of
provision).
15.5. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and made (i) if by
personal delivery, on the date of such delivery, (ii) if by recognized overnight courier specifying next-business-day delivery, on the
next business day after the date of deposit with such courier (by the courier’s stated time for enabling next-business-day delivery),
(iii) if by email, on the date sent by email if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next business day if sent
after normal business hours of the recipient, and (iv) if by US registered mail, on the fifth business day following such mailing in the
US, in each case addressed at the address shown below for, or such other address as may be designated by 10 days’ advance written
notice hereunder by, such Party.

15.6. Entire Agreement and Modification.  The Agreement, including the Exhibits thereto, constitutes the entire understanding between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels any previous or contemporaneous agreements or
understandings, whether oral, written or implied, heretofore in effect, including any letter of intent, and sets forth the entire agreement
between Sekisui and Qualigen with respect to the subject matter hereof (provided, that any and all previous nondisclosure/nonuse
obligations, including the July 7, 2015 Confidential Disclosure Agreement) are not superseded and remain in full force and effect for all
disclosures made prior to the date of this Agreement). Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied, in deciding whether to enter
into this Agreement on this Agreement’s expressly stated terms and conditions, on any representations, warranties, agreements,
commitments or promises which are not expressly set forth within this Agreement. No agreements amending, altering, supplementing
or waiving the terms hereof may be made except by the express terms of a written document signed by duly authorized representatives
of the Parties.
15.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement.
15.8. Attorney Fees. If litigation becomes necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the successful Party shall be entitled to
recover from the other Party reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ and other professional fees, in addition to any other available
remedies.

interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
15.10. Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement may be delivered by email
attachment or other electronic transmission, and such signatures and such delivery shall be fully effective and binding on the Party
sending the same.
15.11. Further Assurances . Each Party covenants and agrees to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge
and deliver any and all such further or other documents and instruments and take any such further or other action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.
15.12. Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable to any other Party or be deemed to have breached or defaulted under this Agreement for
failure or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than obligations for the payment of money)
for the time and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts of God, earthquake, riot, civil commotion, terrorism,
war, strikes or other labor disputes, fire, flood, failure or delay of transportation, omissions or delays in acting by a governmental
authority, acts of a government or an agency thereof or judicial orders or decrees or restrictions or any other like reason which is
beyond the control of the respective Party. The Party affected by force majeure shall provide the other Party with full particulars
thereof as soon as it becomes aware of the same (including its best estimate of the likely extent and duration of the interference with
its activities), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome the difficulties created thereby and to resume performance of
its obligations hereunder as soon as practicable, and the time for performance shall be extended for a number of days equal to the
duration of the force majeure.
15.13. Equitable Relief. Each Party recognizes that the covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this
Agreement are necessary and critical to protect the legitimate interests of the other Party, that the other Party would not have entered
into this Agreement in the absence of such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in
this Agreement, and that a Party’s breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements will cause the opposed Party
irreparable harm and significant injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus making any
remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Therefore, each Party agrees that an opposed Party shall be entitled to specific performance,
an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of Section 13 and all other provisions of this Agreement, and any other equitable
relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), without the necessity of posting of any
bond or security. This right shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other Party at law or in
equity.
15.14. Rights and Remedies are Cumulative . Except to the extent as may be expressly set forth herein, all rights, remedies, undertakings,
obligations and agreements contained in or available upon violation of this Agreement shall be cumulative and none of them shall be
in limitation of any other remedy or right authorized in law or in equity, or any undertaking, obligation or agreement of the applicable
Party.

for the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the Parties to
confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person.
15.16. No Implied License. No right or license is granted to Sekisui by implication, estoppel, or otherwise to any know-how, patent or other
intellectual property right owned or controlled by Qualigen.

reference is made thereto.

● Warranty Agreement Revenue and other Service Contract Revenue. Any such revenue shall belong exclusively to Qualigen.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts invoiced by Sekisui and its Affiliates for sales of Products among Sekisui and its Affiliates (‘Sekisui

Actual ‘Gross to Net’ (GTN) Adjustments – consist of:
a) discounts, refunds, rebates, sub distributor “channel” fees, chargebacks, retroactive price adjustments, and any other allowances given
and taken which effectively reduce the net selling price (other than such which have already diminished the gross amount invoiced),
including, without limitation, volume discounts.
b) Product returns and allowances
Net Revenue – Actual Gross Revenue less Actual GTN Adjustments

manufacturing variances including purchase price and material usage variances as part of Labor & Overhead. If Qualigen’s manufacturing variances

expenses relating to formulation oversight. In Qualigen’s FY 2016 financial data, this allocation represented approximately $60k. Workers’ comp
insurance is included as part of the occupancy allocation in Qualigen’s FY2016 financial results. Beginning with Qualigen’s FY 2017 financial
reporting, Workers’ comp insurance will be included as a direct allocation to the Instrument and Reagent Manufacturing cost centers based on
salary amounts.

instruments sold to Sekisui.
Currently, the Medical Device Excise Tax provision of the Affordable Care Act is repealed (from Jan. 2016 through December 2017). However,
should this provision be re-enacted, or similar such provision enacted, the cost of such excise taxes will be included as a cost element included in
Actual Cost of Goods. The margin share and true-up process will reflect this cost.

represent Qualigen’s 10% share of the actual April 2015 – December 2015 Available Margin as defined in Exhibit A and summarized in Table C.
Going forward, transfer prices for Products other than reagent kits  will be set as of each October 1 and April 1 for the prospective 6-month period
based on Qualigen’s standard unit cost in effect on the first day of the month prior to the date the new transfer prices are agreed upon (either
September 1 and March 1) for the prospective 6-month period.
Going forward, transfer prices for reagent kits  will be set as of each October 1 and April 1 for the prospective 6-month period based on historical
COGS for the earliest 6 months of the 9-month period ended the day before such date plus an amount that is estimated to represent Qualigen’s
applicable share of Available Margin with regard to the retrospective 6-month period as noted in Table A below.

Per Table B below, for each “True-Up Period”, an all-Products true-up will be prepared to ensure each party receives their contractual margin share
of the actual Available Margin. The true-up process will result in a payment due from either party, depending on which party has received excess
Available Margin for the True-Up Period. True-ups will be determined every six months. The first true-up will be based on a stub period consisting
of results from the first day of this Agreement to September 30, 2016.
Table B below provides the true-up periods and Available Margin shares.

10/1/2020 - 3/31/2021 4/3/2021 65% / 35%
Sekisui and Qualigen jointly have the responsibility to review and approve each true-up calculation. The process follows the following steps:
1) Qualigen provides Qualigen-incurred COGS information to Sekisui (see Table C)
2) Sekisui adds its Net Revenue information and Sekisui-incurred COGS information (see Table C) to the Qualigen-incurred COGS information
and develops the first draft of the true-up calculation
3) Qualigen and Sekisui review and agree on the calculation. Both parties will use best efforts to complete the review and approval process in
a timely manner.
Note: to ensure the True-up calculation is available for recording in September or March results, both Qualigen and Sekisui need to be diligent in
providing their data on a timely basis according to the dates set forth in Table B above.

with Section 2.2(A), Company shall pay 8.75% of the Completion Costs associated with the Initial Well and 8.75% of the cost of any newly acquired
surface equipment associated with the Initial Well  beyond the wellhead connections (including but not limited to stock tanks,  separators, treaters,
pumping equipment, piping, and metering devices).
 
2.4  If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well and Company elects not to participate  in such Completion attempt, or is deemed not
to participate, BP may nonetheless continue with such operation and carry Company’s proportionate part of  Completion Costs. If the Completion

be entitled to receive, all of Company’s interest in the Initial Well and share of production therefrom until the proceeds of the sale of such share,
calculated at the well, or market value thereof if such share is not sold (after deducting applicable  ad valorem, production, severance, windfall
profits, and excise taxes, royalty, overriding royalty and other interests payable out of or measured by the  production from the Initial Well accruing
with respect to such interest until  it reverts), shall equal the total of the following:
  (A) twenty six and one-quarter percent (26.25%) of the Completion Costs associated  with the Initial Well and twenty six and
one-quarter percent (26.25%) of the cost of any newly acquired surface equipment beyond the wellhead  connections
(including but not limited to stock tanks, separators,  treaters, pumping equipment, piping and metering devices) ( i.e.,
300% non-consent penalty on a non-promoted basis);  and
  (B) eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) of the cost of operation of the  Initial Well commencing with first production and
continuing until Company’s interest shall revert to it in accordance with this Section 2.4  (i.e., 100% non-consent penalty
on a non-promoted basis).
2.5  Company shall bear its proportionate part, being eight and three quarters percent  (8.75%), of any severance, production and
gathering taxes and any other taxes  imposed or measured by the volume or value of production from the Initial Well, including, but only by way of
illustration, excise taxes and windfall profit taxes, whether enacted by federal, state or local authority.
2.6  The Initial Well shall be plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable  regulations and at the cost, risk and expense of
the parties who participated  in the cost of drilling the Initial Well. Company’s proportionate share of the  cost, risk and expense to plug and abandon
the Initial Well shall be eight and three quarters percent (8.75%).
 
ARTICLE III
SUBSTITUTE WELLS
3.1   If, prior to reaching Casing Point in the Initial Well, BP should encounter geological  or mechanical conditions which render
further operations impracticable or economically infeasible, in the sole reasonable opinion of BP, BP shall (i) give written notice of such occurrence
to Company, and (ii) such notice shall state  whether BP proposes to attempt to Complete the Initial Well in a shallower Zone or to abandon the
Initial Well as a dry hole.(A) If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well without reaching the Objective Zone, such notice shall also include a
completion AFE. The completion AFE shall include, at a minimum, an estimate of Completion Costs for the Initial Well.
Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to
elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well
until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of
Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since  Company’s receipt of BP’s notice. Failure to respond within the time
period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate  in the Completion of the Initial Well. If BP proposes to
Complete the Initial Well and Company elects not to participate in such Completion attempt,  or is deemed not to
participate, BP may nonetheless continue with such  operation and carry Company’s proportionate part of Completion
Costs in accordance with Section 2.4.
  (B) If BP proposes to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole, (i) BP shall plug and abandon the Initial Well in accordance with
Section 2.6, and (ii) Company shall have no right or option to takeover the Initial Well.
3.2  If BP does not drill the Initial Well to the Objective Zone, Company shall have the  right, but not the obligation, for a period of
one (1) year from the date the drilling rig used to drill the Initial Well is removed from the well site location for the Initial Well (the “Rig Release
Date”), to participate in the drilling of a Substitute Well. BP shall have no obligation to drill a Substitute Well, and Company shall have no right to
propose a Substitute Well. If and  when BP elects to drill a Substitute Well, BP shall provide Company with an AFE for the Substitute Well. The AFE
for the Substitute Well shall include, at a minimum, the surface and bottomhole location of the Substitute Well, the  Objective Zone, and the
estimated costs for the Substitute Well as a dry hole  and as a producer. Company shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such  written notice to
elect whether it shall participate in such Substitute Well.  Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an  election not to
participate in the Substitute Well.
3.3  If BP proposes to drill a Substitute Well and Company timely elects to participate  in such Substitute Well in accordance with
Section 3.2, such Substitute Well shall be treated for all purposes herein as the Initial Well (including, but not  limited to, Company’s obligation to

an eight and three quarters percent (8.75%)  working interest in the Initial Well and an undivided eight and three quarters  percent (8.75%) interest in
the BP Interests, but limited as to the geographic  boundaries of the Unit in which the Initial Well is located and further limited as to those depths
between the surface and the stratigraphic equivalent of  the deepest Zone penetrated in the Initial Well (the “Partial Interest”). BP and  Company
shall conduct operations with respect to such Initial Well as if they  have entered into the Operating Agreement until such well or a Substitute Well
is drilled to and successfully Completed in the Objective Zone or until this  Agreement is terminated; provided, however, if this Agreement is to be
terminated without Company earning its proportionate share of the BP Interests  in accordance with Section 4.1, then the Parties shall enter into an
operating agreement in the form of the Operating Agreement except that the contract area  of such operating agreement shall be limited to the Partial

5.2  BP shall deliver to Company the Well Information derived from or attributable to the Initial Well and any Substitute Well and
Additional Well, if such Well Information is acquired, obtained, or performed by BP.
5.3   The Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well shall be under the  exclusive control of BP and the operation
thereof shall be conducted in a  prudent and workmanlike manner. BP shall conduct all its activities under this Agreement as a reasonable prudent
operator, in a good and workmanlike manner, with due diligence and dispatch, in accordance with good oilfield practice,  and in compliance with

Agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.
5.6  Unless Company elects by thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to BP either to take in kind or to separately dispose of its share
of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons,  BP shall in good faith, to the extent it can do so, cause Company’s share of  production from the Initial Well and
each Substitute Well and Additional Wells  to be marketed and sold to either a Third Party or to an Affiliate of BP in a commercially reasonable
manner, which terms shall not be less than on the same  terms and conditions as BP’s share of production from such wells are sold. It is  recognized
by the Parties that BP, or its predecessor, has provided at its  cost or made arrangements with Third Parties to provide certain facilities beyond  the
wellhead (the “Plants”) needed for producing, storing, separating, gathering,  treating, processing and delivering production from the Initial Well
and each Substitute Well and Additional Well. It is agreed that BP will continue to make the Plants (as they or any contractual arrangements related
thereto may be modified, changed or upgraded) proportionately available to handle BP, Company  and Third Party production from the Contract
Area. It is understood that a  proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the Plants,  including depreciation or rental in lieu of
depreciation and actual Third Party  costs, whether on a cash fee basis or on a retained volume basis, will be  allocated to the Parties on a
“throughput” basis (being that portion of such  costs relating to the production volumes from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or
Additional Well, as each may bear to the total production  volumes handled by the Plants, including any Third Party or BP volumes not  produced
from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or Additional Well). Nothing herein shall be construed to impart, transfer or convey any
ownership interest in the Plants to Company.5.7  If any lands within the Contract Area (other than those lands covered by the Leases)  contain an interest which is unleased or

occurrence of the cause relied upon, the obligations  of such Party, upon giving said notice, so far as such Party’s ability to  perform such
obligations are materially affected by such Force Majeure, shall  be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused, and the cause  of
the Force Majeure as far as possible shall be remedied with all reasonable  dispatch. The term "Force Majeure" means one or a set of circumstances

condition (except financial) whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not reasonably within the  control of the Party claiming Force
Majeure. The above requirement that any  Force Majeure shall be remedied with all reasonable dispatch shall not require  the settlement of strikes,
lockouts or other labor difficulty by acceding to  the demands of opponents therein when such course is inadvisable in the discretion  of the Party
claiming Force Majeure.ARTICLE X

This First Amendment will be effective as of July 5, 2011, upon the signature of both Cargill and BioAmber.  
Cargill and Bioamber mutually agree as follows:  
  
  
The Parties, through their authorized representatives, hereby agree to the terms and conditions of this First Amendment.    
  Cargill Confidential  * Confidential treatment requested 
1. Section 2.2 of the Development Agreement is hereby amended to allow Cargill at its sole discretion to apply [***] during the period of July 5, 2011, through September 30, 2011, to perform the Work Plan in addition to the [***] specified in the unamended Section 2.2. The terms for compensation and expenses for these additional FTEs will be as provided for the original FTEs in Section 2.2. 
2. Other than as expressly modified by this First Amendment, all terms and conditions of the Development Agreement continue without modification.

/s/ Jack Staboch     /s/ Jim MillisSignature     SignatureVP BioTDC     CTOTitle     Title7/14/11     7/18/11AMENDMENTS TO COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT  AGREEMENT  
WHEREAS, Cargill, Incorporated (“Cargill”) and BioAmber S.A.S. (“Bioamber”) entered into a Development Agreement having an Effective Date of April 15, 2010, as amended on July 5, 2011 (the “Development Agreement”);  
WHEREAS, Cargill and Bioamber entered into a Commercial License Agreement having an Effective Date of April 15, 2010 (the “Commercial License”);  
WHEREAS, Bioamber now desires to amend the Development Agreement to allow Bioamber to fund a research project being conducted by the Biotechnology Research Institute (“BRI”), which involves the molecular re-engineering of a Methylotroph owned by BRI and the development of a lab scale fermentation design for using the re-engineered Methylotroph to make succinic acid or salts thereof from a methanol feedstock (the “BRI Project”). The BRI Project will be co-funded by funds available from the Canadian National Research Council;  
WHEREAS, Bioamber further desires to scale-up the production of succinic acid using a Corynebacteria biocatalyst (MCC-17) available from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (“MCC”) and to possibly produce succinic acid or salts using MCC-17 as an alternative to the E. coli BioAmber has licensed from the DOE at: (1) Bioamber’s existing demonstration-scale succinic acid production facility located at Pomacle, France; and (2) a succinic acid production facility located at Sarnia, Ontario Canada having a maximum production capacity of 35,000 metric tons of succinic acid per year (the “Sarnia Plant”). Together these scale-up projects will be referred to as the “Scale-up and Production Project”;  
WHEREAS, Cargill is willing to allow Bioamber to fund the BRI Project and to conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to the following terms and conditions. Now therefore the Parties agree:  
Amendment To the Development Agreement  
A. Section 13.9 of the Development Agreement is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:  
“Notwithstanding the above, Bioamber may fund the BRI Project up until the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrates the ability to produce succinic acid (or salts thereof) from any feedstock at a concentration of [***] grams/liter succinic acid (or salts thereof). Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.  
B. New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:  
“13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as described above.”  
Amendment To the Commercial License  
A. Section 5.9 of the Commercial License is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:  
“Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.”  
Nothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber’s obligations to replace MCC-17 and Bioamber’s current E. coli strain with CB1 in all the existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees, according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the Commercial License.

Sales of such Product in such country during any Calendar Quarter following the Launch Quarter are less than the Designated Percentage (as
defined below) of average Net Sales occurring during the [***] immediately preceding the Launch Quarter (such average Net Sales during such
Calendar Quarters, the “ Base Net Sales ”), then the royalty rates provided in Section 9.3(a) for such Product shall be reduced in such country by
the “Applicable Reduction Percentage” set forth below for such Calendar Quarter and for all future Calendar Quarters, unless and until the Generic

[***] paid by Sanofi to such Third Party in respect of such agreement for such Calendar Quarter, in each case to the extent reasonably allocable to
such Third Party Right and such Product and country; provided that in no event shall the royalties payable for such Product and country in any
Calendar Quarter be reduced to less than [***]% of the amount otherwise due under Section 9.3(a) (the “ Royalty Floor”). If any of such amounts
cannot be offset against royalties due with respect to a Product for any Calendar Quarter because they would result in royalties payable to
RevMed being lower than the Royalty Floor, Sanofi shall have
46

(a) General. Each Party shall be solely responsible for the payment of all income taxes imposed on its share of income arising directly or indirectly
from the activities of the Parties under this Agreement. In the event that Sanofi is required, under Applicable Law, to withhold any deduction or tax from
any payment due to RevMed under this Agreement (taking into account any legally available reduction or elimination of such tax pursuant to an
applicable tax treaty or otherwise), such amount will be deducted from the payment to be made by Sanofi, paid to the proper taxing authority, and Sanofi
will notify RevMed and upon RevMed’s request promptly provide RevMed with copies of any tax certificate or other documentation evidencing such
withholding, provided, however, that in the event that any such withholding tax arises as a result of Sanofi’s re-domiciliation, assignment of its rights or
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate, or use of any Third Party subcontractor, payments to RevMed hereunder shall be made on a grossed-up  basis to
ensure that RevMed receives the same amount it would have in the absence of such withholding. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in
claiming exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any agreement or treaty from time to time in effect.
(b) Value Added Tax. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.7(a), this Section 9.7(b) will apply with respect to value added tax (or sales,
use or indirect tax) (“VAT”). All payments to be made by Sanofi hereunder are exclusive of VAT. If any VAT is chargeable in respect of any such payments,
Sanofi will notify RevMed and pay VAT at the applicable rate in respect of any such payments following the receipt of a VAT invoice in the appropriate
form issued by RevMed in respect of those payments or Sanofi shall self-assess and pay such VAT, such VAT to be payable on the later of the due date
of the payment to which such VAT relates and [***] after the receipt by Sanofi of the applicable invoice relating to that VAT payment.

9.9 Audit Procedures.
(a) Upon reasonable prior notice of the other Party, but in any event at least [***] prior notice, each Party shall and shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their Sublicensees to permit an independent auditor of international prominence, selected by the auditing Party and reasonably acceptable to the
audited Party, to audit the books and records maintained pursuant to Section 9.8 for the sole purpose of verifying for the auditing Party the accuracy of
the financial reports furnished by the audited Party pursuant to this Agreement or of any payments made, or required to be made, by or to the audited
Party pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Such audit shall not occur more than [***] in a given Calendar Year, unless for cause, and
shall not concern books and records relating to a period more than [***] preceding the current Calendar Year. Any failure by a Party to exercise its rights
under this Section 9.9 with respect to a Calendar Year within such [***] period shall constitute a waiver by such Party of its right to later object to any
payments made by the other Party under this Agreement during such Calendar Year.
(b) Upon completion of the audit, the auditor shall provide a report to both Parties, which report shall be limited to a description of any failure to
comply with the terms of this Agreement and the amount of the financial discrepancy. Such auditor shall not disclose the audited Party’s Confidential
Information to the auditing Party, except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to verify the accuracy of the financial reports furnished by the audited
Party or the amount of payments to or by the audited Party under this Agreement. Any amounts shown to be owed but unpaid, or overpaid and in need
of reimbursement, shall be paid or refunded (as the case may be) within [***] after the auditor’s report, plus interest (as set forth in Section 9.6) from the
original due date (unless challenged in good faith by the audited Party in which case any dispute with respect thereto shall be resolved in accordance
with Section 15.6).
(c) The auditing Party shall bear the full cost of such audit unless such audit reveals an underpayment by the audited Party that resulted from a
discrepancy in the financial report provided by the audited Party for the audited period, which underpayment was more than [***] percent of the amount
set forth in such report, in which case the audited Party shall reimburse the auditing Party for the costs for such audit.
(d) The auditing Party shall treat all information subject to review under this Section 9.9 in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of Article
XI and the Parties shall cause the auditor to enter into a reasonably acceptable confidentiality agreement with the audited Party obligating such auditor to
retain all such financial information in confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.

(a) the negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any of the RevMed Indemnitees; or
(b) the material breach of any of the warranties or representations made by RevMed to Sanofi under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or
(c) the material breach by RevMed of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;
except in each case ((a) through (c)), to the extent the applicable Third Party Claim and Losses arising therefrom arise or result from (i) the
negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any Sanofi Indemnitee; (ii) the breach of any of the warranties or representations made by Sanofi to
RevMed under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or (iii) any breach by Sanofi of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement.
14.2 Indemnification by Sanofi. Sanofi shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless RevMed, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
agents and employees (“ RevMed Indemnitees”) from and against any Third Party Claims and Losses arising therefrom under or related to this Agreement
against any of them to the extent arising or resulting from:

Sanofi under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or (iii) any breach by RevMed of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement.
14.3 Indemnification Procedure.
(a) Notice of Claim. All indemnification claims in respect of any Sanofi Indemnitee or RevMed Indemnitee seeking indemnity under Section 14.1 or
Section 14.2 (collectively, the “Indemnitees” and each an “ Indemnitee”) will be made solely by the corresponding Party (the “ Indemnified Party”). The
Indemnified Party will give the indemnifying Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) prompt written notice (an “Indemnification Claim Notice”) of any Losses
or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2, but failure to
provide prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent any Losses
result from such delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of
such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any
Indemnitee in connection with the Third Party Claim.
(b) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification as
provided for in Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party’s receipt of an
Indemnification Claim Notice. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may select and appoint the lead legal counsel for
the defense of the Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable
to the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in
connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.
72
Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020(c) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 14.3(b), any Indemnitee will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment will be at the Indemnitee’s own
expense unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (b) the Indemnifying Party has failed
to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 14.3(b) (in which case the Indemnified Party will control the defense).
(d) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will
not result in the Indemnitee’s becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnitee in any manner,
and as to which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will
have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the
Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. The Indemnifying Party will pay all amounts on behalf of the Indemnified Party at or prior
to the time of the entry of judgment. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any
judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent will be at the Indemnified Party’s sole and absolute discretion). The Indemnifying Party that has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 14.3(b) will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnitee that is reached without the written
consent of such Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee will admit
any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b).
(e) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, and will cause each other
Indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the
Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnitees and other employees and
agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying
Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket  costs in connection with such cooperation.
(f) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a [***] by the Indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the Indemnifying
Party’s right to contest the Indemnified Party’s right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to
be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.
73
Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/202014.4 Mitigation of Loss. Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall procure that its Affiliates take all such reasonable steps and action as are
reasonably necessary or as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require in order to mitigate any Third Party Claims (or potential losses or damages)
under this Article XIV. Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to relieve any Party of any common law or other duty to mitigate any losses
incurred by it.
14.5 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS
OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 14.5 IS
INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY UNDER SECTION 14.1 OR
SECTION 14.2, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY’S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CONFIDENTIALITY UNDER ARTICLE XI
OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER ARTICLE X.
14.6 Insurance. Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including product liability insurance, with respect to its activities hereunder and
under the Ancillary Agreements and which is consistent with normal business practices of companies similarly situated at all times during which any
SHP2 Inhibitors or Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold. Sanofi may fulfill such obligation through self-
insurance. Each Party shall provide the other Party with evidence of such insurance upon request and, in the case of RevMed, shall provide Sanofi with
written notice at least [***] prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or material changes in such insurance. It is understood that such insurance shall not be
construed to create a limit of either Party’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article XIV.
Article XV.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
15.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for
failure or delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the
reasonable control of the affected Party, including embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, civil
commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances (whether involving the workforce of the nonperforming Party or of any other Person), fire,
floods, earthquakes or other acts of God, or acts, generally applicable action or inaction by any governmental authority (but excluding any government
action or inaction that is specific to such Party, its Affiliates or Sublicensees, such as revocation or non-renewal of such Party’s license to conduct
business), or omissions or delays in acting by the other Party, or unavailability of materials related to the Manufacture of the Products (each cause, an
event of “ Force Majeure”). The affected Party shall give notice to the other Party in writing as soon as reasonably practical but no later than [***] after
the occurrence of the event of Force Majeure, specifying the nature and extent of the event of Force Majeure, its anticipated duration and any
74
Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020action being taken to avoid or minimize its effect. The suspension of performance allowed hereunder shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration
than is reasonably required, and the affected Party shall promptly undertake and continue diligently all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force
majeure circumstances or to perform its obligations in spite of the ongoing circumstances. In the event that RevMed is the non-performing Party and the
Force Majeure continues for more than [***] (which period, in its entirety or a portion thereof, is prior to the commencement of the Registration Program
for a Product, which Development thereof is impacted by such Force Majeure), Sanofi’s payment obligations under Article IX shall be suspended until
notification by RevMed to Sanofi of the termination of such Force Majeure Event (and any related triggers and deadlines shall be similarly suspended).
15.2 Assignment; Change of Control.
(a) Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except as expressly permitted hereunder, or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the consent of the other Party, except as
follows:
(i) Sanofi may, without consent of RevMed, assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate
of Sanofi, and RevMed may, with the consent of Sanofi (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), assign this Agreement or its
rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of RevMed; and
(ii) Either Party may, without consent of the other Party, assign this Agreement in whole to (i) in the case of RevMed, its successor in interest
or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in the case of a Change of Control or (ii) in the case of Sanofi, its successor in interest or assignee or
purchaser, as applicable, in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates, or in connection with a
merger, acquisition or similar transaction. In the case of Sanofi the intellectual property owned or controlled by any such successor in interest or
assignee or purchaser (such successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, an “ Acquiror”) or its Acquiror Family prior to the
applicable Change of Control or other similar transaction immediately prior to such acquisition (other than as a result of a license from the acquired
Party) or thereafter developed outside the scope of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement shall be excluded from [***] and the
Acquiror Family shall be excluded from “Affiliate” solely for purposes of the applicable components of the intellectual property definitions set forth
herein. In the case of RevMed, the intellectual property owned or controlled by any such Acquiror or its Acquiror Family prior to the applicable
Change of Control or other similar transaction immediately prior to such acquisition (other than as a result of a license from the acquired Party) or is
thereafter developed outside the scope of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement shall be excluded from the RevMed Licensed
Technology, in each case only for so long as the remainder of the conditions of this Section 15.2 are met, and the Acquiror Family shall be excluded
from “Affiliate” solely for purposes of the applicable components of the intellectual property definitions set forth herein, in all such cases if and
only if: (A) the acquired Party remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror; (B) all intellectual property of the Acquired Party Family and
75
Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020all research and development assets and operations of the Acquired Party Family, in each case relating to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products, remain
with the Acquired Party Family and are not licensed or otherwise transferred to the Acquiror Party Family for any purpose; (C) the scientific and
Development activities with respect to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products of the Acquired Party Family and Competing Products of the Acquiror Family
(if any) are maintained separate and distinct, and (D) there is no exchange of Know-How relating to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products between the
Acquired Party Family and the Acquiror Family. Any attempted assignment not in accordance with this Section 15.2 shall be null and void and of
no legal effect. Any permitted assignee shall assume all assigned obligations of its assignor under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respected successors and permitted assigns. For
clarity, any assignment by Sanofi shall be subject to Section 9.7(a).
(b) Except as part of a transaction permitted under this Section 15.2, in no event shall RevMed assign or transfer, or agree to assign or transfer to
any Third Party, any or all of the RevMed Licensed Patents without the consent of Sanofi, not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned.
15.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law and if the rights
or obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision shall be fully severable, (ii)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (iii) the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance here from and (iv) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and reasonably acceptable
to the Parties. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Party hereby waives any provision of law that would render any provision hereof
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect.
15.4 Notices. All notices which are required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered personally, sent by e-mail (and

payable under this Agreement, and (c) such withholding taxes exceed the amount of withholding taxes that would have been applicable but for such
assignment or delegation, then any such amount payable shall be increased to take into account such withholding taxes as may be necessary so that,

the other Party to minimize the withholding tax implications of any such assignment or delegation.

reports with Xencor and the accounting firm. Information, disclosures, or reports arising from any such examination shall be Confidential Information of

event shall such rate exceed the maximum legal annual interest rate. The payment of such interest shall not limit Xencor from exercising any other rights it

(each, an “Infringement Claim”). With respect to any Infringement Claim, the Parties shall attempt to negotiate in good faith a resolution with respect
thereto. If the Parties cannot settle such Infringement Claim with the appropriate Third Parties within [***] ([***]) days after the receipt of the notice
pursuant to this Section 9.4.1, then the following shall apply:

give prompt written notification to the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be

any one coverage. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change

(a) is publicly disclosed by the disclosing Party, either before or after it becomes known to the receiving Party;
(b) was known to the receiving Party or any or its Affiliates, without any obligation to keep it confidential, prior to when it was
received from the disclosing Party;
(c) is subsequently disclosed to the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates by a Third Party that is lawfully in possession thereof
without obligation to keep it confidential;
(d) has been published by a Third Party or otherwise enters the public domain through no fault of the receiving Party or any of its
Affiliates in breach of this Agreement; or
(e) has been independently developed or acquired by the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates without the aid, application or use of
the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
12.1.2 The receiving Party shall have the right to disclose any Confidential Information provided by the other Party hereunder if, in the
reasonable opinion of the receiving Party’s legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or the
requirements of any law or rule imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange or other Applicable Law, but only to
the extent of such necessity or requirements; and no such disclosure shall cause any such information to cease to be Confidential Information hereunder,
except to the extent such disclosure results in a public disclosure of such information. Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the
disclosing Party of the receiving Party’s intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior
to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to
protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.
12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only
to (i) the receiving Party’s attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent
accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party’s Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers,
employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who
have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the
37
Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020activities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is
subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use  with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of
confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any
failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates’ respective directors, officers, employees,
consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential
Information as required under this Section 12.1.
For clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party’s U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the
transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax
analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that
nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.
12.1.4 Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching Party
irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the
event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in
equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without
the posting of bond or other security.
12.2 Publicity. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties shall each issue the applicable press release in the form attached hereto as
Schedule 12.2, with respect to this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted
without the other Party’s consent to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both
Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party’s counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although,
prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable
notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.
12.3 Securities Filings.  In the event either Party proposes to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or the securities
regulators of any state or other jurisdiction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other
applicable securities law a registration statement or any other disclosure document which describes or refers to this Agreement, such Party shall notify
the other Party of such intention and shall provide such other Party with a copy of relevant portions of the proposed filing not less than [***] ([***])
Business Days prior to such filing (or such shorter period of time as may be required in the circumstances, and any revisions to such
38
Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020portions of the proposed filing a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof), and shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to consider such comments
to the extent consistent with such Party’s disclosure obligations under applicable securities laws or rules of a securities exchange.
12.4 Publications. Except for disclosures permitted under this Agreement, if Xencor, its Affiliates, or its employee(s) or consultant(s) wishes to
make a publication or presentation specific to the Product or which otherwise may reasonably contain Know-How, or other intellectual property, of
Aimmune, Xencor must receive written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, from Aimmune at least [***] ([***]) days
prior to submission for publication or presentation. If Aimmune, its Affiliates, or its employee(s) or consultant(s) wishes to make a publication specific to
the Product or which otherwise may reasonably contain Xencor Technology, Aimmune shall deliver to Xencor a copy of the proposed written publication
or an outline of an oral disclosure at least [***] ([***]) days prior to submission for publication or presentation and reasonably consider any comments
of Xencor thereon; provided that subject to Sections 12.1 through 12.3, to the extent such publication describes or is specific to Xencor Technology,
Aimmune must receive written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, from Xencor prior to submitting such publication to
any Third Party.
12.5 Use of Names. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, neither Party shall use the name of the other Party in relation to this
transaction in any public announcement, press release or other public document without the written consent of such other Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that subject to Section 12.3, either Party may use the name of the other Party in any document filed with
any Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority, including the Securities and Exchange Commission or the rules of any securities exchange.
12.6 Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information. Each Party shall have a response plan in place for any disclosure of Confidential
Information that is not authorized or otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Such plan shall include considerations of, among other things,
notification, remediation and retrieval. In the event that a Party becomes aware of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, then such Party
shall notify the other Party promptly in writing.
12.7 Prior CDA. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this ARTICLE 12 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure,  secrecy or confidentiality
agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the
Parties dated [***]. Any information disclosed pursuant to any such prior agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of the applicable Party for
purposes of this Agreement, to the extent that such information was deemed to be “Proprietary Information” under such prior agreement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Aimmune Licenses Exclusive Worldwide Rights to Xencor’s XmAb®7195 for the
Development of Next-Generation Food Allergy Treatments
BRISBANE, Calif. – February 5, 2020  – Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for
potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the
investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb ®7195 from Xencor, Inc.
XmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct
mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive
treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT™) programs, including PALFORZIA™, to explore treatment outcomes in
patients with food allergies.
“As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of
desensitization – and perhaps even remission – when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,” said Jayson Dallas, M.D.,
President and CEO of Aimmune. “In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune’s global
leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.”
“Aimmune’s focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly
complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,” said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of
Xencor. “AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction
would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238
newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of
certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones — beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial — and is eligible to
receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related
to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.
About AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb®7195)
AIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with
allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response
Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020in patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B
cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than
100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.
About Aimmune
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for
patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments
for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company’s Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT™) approach is intended to
provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with

prices in calculating the Net Sales of the Combination Product. If the weighted average sale price cannot be determined for the
Product or other product(s) containing the single licensed compound or component(s), the calculation of Net Sales for
Combination Products will be agreed by the Parties based on the relative value contributed by each component (each Party’s
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

extent permitted under Section 4.5 below.
2.2 Sublicensees and Distributors.
(a)  It is understood and acknowledged that Array’s decision to select Ono to commercialize Products in the Ono
Territory was based in part on the understanding that Ono currently markets pharmaceutical products in the Ono Territory and that
Ono intends to market Products in the same manner. Ono shall have the right, in accordance with this Section 2.2, to grant
sublicenses under the Array Patents and Array Know-How to its Affiliates and to Third Parties, provided that Ono shall not
engage a Third Party as either (i) a Sublicensee of the Product, or (ii) as a distributor of the Product, without Array’s prior written
consent. For clarity, a wholesaler shall not be considered a “distributor” for purposes of the foregoing restriction.
(b) Ono shall ensure that each of its Sublicensees and distributors is bound by a written agreement between Ono and such
Sublicensee or distributor that does not conflict with, and contains provisions as protective of the Products and Array, as this
Agreement. Without limiting any of Ono’s obligations under this Agreement, Ono shall also ensure that each Sublicensee expressly
agrees in writing to be bound by all of Ono’s obligations under this Agreement to the extent applicable to such Sublicensee,
including without limitation, the following provisions of this Agreement (as if such Sublicensee were expressly named in each such
provision, to the extent Ono’s Sublicensees are not so named therein): Sections 2.6 (Grantback License to Array), 4.7 (Exchange
of Data and Know-How); 4.8 (Right of Reference and Access to Data); 7.4 (Records), 8.2 (Exclusivity of Efforts) and 14.2
(transition obligations on termination).
(c)  Ono shall in all cases remain responsible for any actions of its Affiliates and Sublicensees exercising rights under a
sublicense of the rights granted by Array to Ono under this Agreement to the same extent as if such actions had been taken by
Ono itself.
(d)  Promptly following the execution of each Sublicense to a Sublicensee, Ono shall provide Array with an executed copy
of such Sublicense which may be redacted as described below (together with a detailed English summary of such sublicense
agreement if such Sublicense was originally executed in a language other than English); and Ono shall also provide to Array an
executed copy (which may be redacted as described below) of any amendment to a Sublicense that relates to a Product (together
with a detailed English summary of such amendment, if such amendment was originally executed in a language other than English),

obligations under this Agreement.
(e)  Ono shall not grant sublicenses or appoint distributors other than in accordance with this Section 2.2.
2.3 Third Party Technology Acquired after Effective Date.
(a)  Generally. If after the Effective Date, Array or Ono (the “Sublicensing Party”) acquire rights from a Third Party that
are to be licensed to the other Party under this Agreement, respectively (“Third Party Technology”), but that is subject to royalty
or other payment obligations to the Third Party, then the following shall apply: The licenses granted to the other Party (the
“Commercializing Party”) hereunder with respect to such Third Party Technology shall be subject to the Commercializing Party's
agreeing to promptly reimburse and promptly reimbursing the Sublicensing Party for any milestone payments, royalties or other
amounts that become owing to such Third Party by reason of the Commercializing Party's exercise of such license or sublicense to
the Third Party Technology. To the extent that any such payments made by a Sublicensing Party under an agreement to acquire
Third Party Technology are not attributable to either the Array Territory or Ono Territory, but are attributable to the acquisition of
rights to a Third Party Technology used for the Product, such payments shall be allocated [ * ] to Array and [ * ] to Ono to the
extent that such Third Party Technology has been licensed by the Sublicensing Party on a global basis and is equally applicable to
the Products being sold in the Array Territory and the Ono Territory. In all other cases such costs shall be allocated between
Array and Ono by the JDRC on a pro rata basis based on the respective value of Third Party Technology in the Array Territory
or Ono Territory. At the inception of the inclusion of any Third Party Technology in such license under this Agreement and
thereafter upon request by the Commercializing Party, the Sublicensing Party shall disclose to the Commercializing Party a true,
complete and correct written description of such payment obligations, and the Commercializing Party's obligation to reimburse
such amounts following such request shall be limited to those payment obligations as so disclosed by the Commercializing Party. In
the event that the Commercializing Party does not agree to reimburse or does not promptly reimburse the Sublicensing Party for
such amounts upon request (such amounts as determined by the JDRC in accordance with this Agreement, to the extent so
provided above), then such Third Party Technology shall thereafter be deemed excluded from the licenses or other subject matter
licensed hereunder.

reasonably useful for Ono’s Development, preparation of MAAs and filing of MAAs with respect to Products in the Ono Territory
or Commercialization of the Product in the Ono Territory and (B) without charge, however it is understood that a failure of Array
to obtain such rights shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 2.4. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
Array agrees that it shall not provide such future Third Party Partner with access to Data and Improvements generated by Ono or
a right of reference with respect to Ono’s Regulatory Filings except to the extent such Third Party Partner agrees to Ono with
reciprocal access to data, know-how, rights of reference and improvements generated by such Third Party Partner. It is further
agreed that to the extent that such future Third Party Partner conditions Ono’s access to such data, know-how, rights of reference
and improvements on payment from Ono, Ono may require that Array conditions such future Third Party Partner’s access to
Ono’s data, know-how, rights of reference and improvements on receipt of similar payment.

DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY ACTIVITIES
4.1 Overview.
(a)  General. Except as otherwise expressly provided in a Joint Development Plan, Ono (itself or through its Affiliates or
respective licensees or sublicensees) shall be responsible for the Development of the Products for the Ono Territory. All
Development activities conducted by or on behalf of Ono hereunder shall be conducted in accordance with the Development Plan
or Joint Development Plan(s), as applicable, and in compliance with applicable Law, including laws regarding environmental,
safety and industrial hygiene, Good Laboratory Practice and Good Clinical Practice, current standards for pharmacovigilance

Development Plan, Ono shall bear all of the costs and expenses which it incurs in connection with any of the activities it performs
in the course of the Development of the Products for the Ono Territory.
(b) Collaborative Development. The Parties recognize that since the Products will be developed both in the Ono Territory
and the Array Territory, regulatory and budget efficiencies can be achieved through the Parties’ coordination and worldwide use of
preclinical and clinical data and in cooperatively conducting certain joint Clinical Studies. Accordingly, the Parties agree that it is
their mutual interest to cooperatively conduct the Approved Clinical Studies to be agreed upon and set forth in Joint Development
Plans as described in Section 4.4 below.
(c)  Current Development Status. Prior to the Effective Date, Novartis AG (“Novartis”) and/or Array have independently
initiated the following Clinical Studies of the Products: (i) a Phase III clinical trial in NRAS Melanoma (“NEMO Clinical Study”),
(ii) a Phase III clinical trial in BRAF Melanoma (“COLUMBUS Clinical Study”), (iii) a Phase III clinical trial in BRAF Colorectal
Cancer (“BEACON Clinical Study”), and (iv) those additional Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Studies and Investigator Sponsored
Clinical Studies set forth in Exhibit 4.1 (collectively, the “Existing Clinical Studies”). Array shall use Diligent Efforts to complete, at
its expense, the Existing Clinical Studies (including all pharmacovigilance aspects), including contracting and managing any contract
research organization(s) that may be involved in such Existing Clinical Studies, and Array shall keep the JDRC informed of the
status thereof and Ono

authorize the protocol for Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study in the Ono Territory and support such Clinical Study at Ono’s
own discretion so long as such study does not fall within one of the categories listed in the IST Guidelines, however Ono agrees to
inform Array of all such Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study(ies) in order to allow Array to provide Ono comments with respect
to such proposed Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study(ies) in a timely manner. For clarity, in the event that a proposed
Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study falls within one of the categories listed in the IST Guidelines, then authorization of such
Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study shall require the agreement between the Parties through the JDRC.
4.2 Development Plan; Amendments.
(a)  Initial Development Plan. Promptly following the Effective Date, and in any event within one hundred and twenty (120)

(b) Joint Development Plans. Pursuant to Section 4.4(a), the Working Group designated by JDRC shall in good faith
discuss and prepare the Joint Development Plan covering Approved Clinical Study(ies) for review by JDRC.
(i) Once Joint Development Plan prepared by the Working Group is approved at JDRC, the Parties shall initiate the
Approved Clinical Study(ies) in accordance with the Joint Development Plan.
(ii) In the event that the JDRC is unable to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for such Approved Clinical Study within
sixty (60) days after the applicable Joint Study Proposal has been approved by the JDRC, each Party shall be free to carry out
such Approved Clinical Study(ies) at its own expense independently upon notice to the other Party, and subject to the terms of
Sections 2.1 and 4.4(c).
(iii) The JDRC shall review the Joint Development Plan on an ongoing basis from time-to-time as needed. The JDRC may
make adjustments to the then-current Joint Development Plan from time-to-time as it deems appropriate.
(c)  Consequences of Rejection of Joint Clinical Study Proposals or Joint Development Plan.
(i) In case of the rejection of a Joint Clinical Proposal by the JDRC pursuant to Section 4.4(a)(ii) or the inability of the
Parties to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for an Approved Clinical Study as described in Section 4.4(b)(ii), each Party may,
upon notice to the other Party, conduct the relevant Clinical Study described in the Joint Clinical Study Proposal (hereinafter the
“Declined Clinical Study”) at its own expense, subject to Section 2.1 above; provided, however, that:
(A) any Declined Clinical Study conducted by Ono (or its Affiliates or Sublicensees) shall be conducted solely within the
Ono Territory;
(B) each Party, should it elect to conduct any Declined Clinical Study on its own shall keep the JDRC and the other Party
informed as to the design of any such Declined Clinical Study(ies) to be conducted by or under its authority;
informed as to the design of any such Declined Clinical Study(ies) to be conducted by or under its authority;

28[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
(D) if the Party that is not conducting a Declined Clinical Study (the “Non-Performing Party”) determines reasonably and in
good faith that the Declined Clinical Study is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Development or Commercialization of the
Products in the Field, then the Party performing such Declined Clinical Study (the “Performing Party”) shall not undertake such
Declined Clinical Study unless and until the JDRC determines that such Declined Clinical Study should be permitted; and
(E) The Performing Party shall provide formal written reports of the results of the Declined Clinical Study and the costs of
such Declined Clinical to the Non-Performing Party when such written reports are available, and the JDRC during meetings of the
JDRC, upon request of the other Party but not more than twice a year during the period in which any study within the Declined
Clinical Study is being performed. For clarity, Section 18.11 shall apply with respect to Declined Clinical Studies undertaken by
either Party in accordance with this Section 4.4(c).
(ii) Costs of Declined Clinical Studies and Use of related Data. The Performing Party shall bear all costs associated with
Declined Clinical Studies it undertakes. If Ono (or an Ono Affiliate or Sublicensee) submits to a Regulatory Authority in Ono
Territory Data generated by Array (including its Affiliates) or a Third Party Partner pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either
directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product
for the same Indication that was the subject of study in such Declined Clinical Study, Ono shall reimburse Array an amount equal
to [ * ] of the costs incurred by Array (including by its Affiliates) and/or such Third Party Partner for the Declined Clinical Study. If
Array (including its Affiliates) and/or PFM submits to a Regulatory Authority in the Array Territory Data generated by Ono
pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or

(a)  Initial Royalty Term. During the Initial Royalty Term for a Product in a particular country of the Ono
Territory, the royalty rate applicable to such Product in such country under Section 6.3(a) (i) above is subject to reduction in
certain events, based on the level of competition from Generic Versions of such Product in such country as follows. During the
Initial Royalty Term for a Product in a country:
(i) If Generic Market Share with respect to such Product in such country equals or exceeds [ * ], then
for so long as such Generic Market Share with respect to such Product equals or exceeds [ * ] in such country, the royalty rate

(i) If Generic Market Share with respect to such Product in such country equals or exceeds [ * ], but is
less than [ * ], then the royalty rate under Section 6.3(a) (ii) applicable to the Annual Net Sales of such Product in such country
shall be [ * ].
(ii) If Generic Market Share with respect to such Product in such country equals or exceeds [ * ], then
the royalty rate under Section 6.3(a) (ii) applicable to Annual Net Sales of such Product in such country shall be equal to [ * ].
(b)  Certain Terms. For purposes of this Section 6.4:
(i)  “Generic Version” means a product that: (i) contains as an active pharmaceutical ingredient a
chemical composition that is assigned the same INN (international nonproprietary name) or JAN (Japanese Accepted Names for
Pharmaceuticals) as is assigned to active pharmaceutical ingredient contained in the corresponding Product being marketed in the
Ono Territory; (ii) obtained Marketing Approval in a country in the Ono Territory by means of an abridged procedure that relies
(A) in whole or in part on the safety and efficacy data contained in the MAA for such Product submitted by Ono in such country,

ARTICLE VII  
PAYMENTS; BOOKS AND RECORDS
7.1 Payment Method. All payments under this Agreement shall be made by bank wire transfer in immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Party to which such payments are due. Any payments or portions thereof due under this
Agreement that are not paid by the date such payments are due under this Agreement shall bear interest at a rate equal Libor US
Dollars one month with respect to payments in US Dollars, or the one month equivalent interbank offered rate with respect to
payments in other currencies, plus in each case [ * ]  per year, calculated on the number of days such payment is delinquent,
compounded monthly and computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty five (365) day year. This Section 7.1 shall in no way limit
any other remedies available to the Parties.
7.2 Currency Conversion. All amounts specified in this Agreement are in Japanese Yen. All payments hereunder shall be
made in US Dollars. All such payment shall be converted into US Dollars at the exchange rate (TTS rate) for the conversion of
Japanese Yen into US Dollars posted by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. on the date on which Ono will make the
applicable payment hereunder, provided that no deduction from any amount shall be made in respect of bank fees or charges. All
such payments shall be paid by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to bank account designated in writing by Array

45[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
Account name: [ * ]
Reference: [ * ]
Account number: [ * ]
Bank name: [ * ]

[ * ]
If any currency conversion shall be required in connection with the payment of royalties or other amounts under this
Agreement, such conversion shall be calculated using at the exchange rate for the conversion of foreign currency into Japanese
Yen posted by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
7.3 Taxes.
(a) Withholding Taxes. If Laws or regulations require withholding by Ono of any taxes imposed upon Array on
account of any royalties or other payments paid under this Agreement, such taxes shall be deducted by Ono as required by Law
from such payment and shall be paid by Ono to the proper taxing authorities. Ono shall use Diligent Efforts to secure official
receipts of payment of any withholding tax and shall send them to Array as evidence of such payment. Array shall provide to Ono
any taxation documents (Form 3 and Form 17), and the Residency Certificate of Array issued by the US Internal Revenue
Service (which Residency Certificate is effective for three (3) years after its issuance to a public company) that may be reasonably
necessary in order for Ono not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall exercise their reasonable efforts to ensure that any withholding taxes imposed are
reduced as far as possible under the provisions of any applicable tax treaty, and shall cooperate in filing any forms required for
such reduction. Each Party shall cooperate with the other and furnish the other Party with appropriate documents to secure
application of the most favorable rate of withholding tax under applicable Law (or exemption from such withholding tax payments,
as applicable).
(b) Sales Taxes. Any sales taxes (including any consumption tax or value added tax), use tax, transfer taxes, duties or
similar governmental charges required to be paid in connection with the transfer to a Party of a Product (including for clarity, Drug
Substance or Drug Product) produced by or on behalf of the supplying Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be the sole
responsibility of the receiving Party. In the event that the supplying Party is required to pay any
46[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
such amounts, the receiving Party shall promptly remit payment to the supplying Party of such amounts.
7.4 Records; Inspection. Ono shall keep, and require its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep, complete, true and accurate
books of accounts and records for the purpose of determining the amounts payable to Array pursuant to this Agreement. Such
books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. Such
records will be open for inspection during such three (3) year period by an independent certified public accounting firm of
nationally (the US or Japan) recognized standing (the “Auditor”), chosen by Array and reasonably acceptable to Ono for the
purpose of verifying the amounts payable by Ono hereunder. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Calendar
Year, at reasonable times and on reasonable prior written notice. Such records for any particular calendar quarter shall be subject
to no more than one inspection. The Auditor shall be obligated to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement prior to
commencing any such inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.4 shall be at the expense of Array, unless a variation
or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [ * ] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection
is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period and any unpaid amounts that are
discovered shall be paid by Ono, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the rate set forth in Section 7.1 above. The
Parties will endeavor in such inspection to minimize disruption of Ono’s normal business activities to the extent reasonably
practicable. For clarity, while Ono does not engage in the bundling of products as of the Effective Date, in the event that Ono
elects in the future to provide a discount for the purchase of a bundle of products that includes a Product, or if its Affiliates or
Sublicensees sell Product as part of said discounted bundle, such discount shall be allocated to Product, for purposes of this
Agreement, based on the ratio, calculated on a quarterly basis, of Product sales to sales of all of Ono’s products sold in the Ono
Territory. It is understood that the foregoing audit rights shall include the right to have the Auditor verify Ono’s compliance (and the
compliance of its Affiliates and Sublicensees) with the above requirements.
ARTICLE VIII

1934, as amended.
Approvals), and thereafter shall use Diligent Efforts to Commercialize the Product(s) for such Indication(s) in the Ono Territory in
a manner intended to maximize Net Sales in the Ono Territory as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, a decision by Ono not to
seek a new or expanded Marketing Approval for a Product in the Ono Territory based on a Declined Clinical Study or a
Combination Study shall not constitute a breach by Ono of its diligence under this Section 8.1(a).
(b)  Conflicts of Interest. Ono and its Affiliates shall set prices and discounts for and shall otherwise Develop and
Commercialize the Products solely in the interest of the commercial success of such Products in the Ono Territory and not for the

have a duration of at least five (5) years from the date of first disclosure of such information to such institutions, investigators,
CROs, and other Third Parties, and (B) the receiving Party uses Diligent Efforts to limit the amount of information disclosed to
such institutions, investigators, CROs, and other Third Parties. For clarity, it is understood that Array may use and disclose, in
accordance with the foregoing, Ono Know-How provided to Array by Ono, and that Ono may use and disclose, in accordance

a need to know basis, in each case under appropriate confidentiality provisions substantially equivalent to those in this Agreement;
or (b) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws and court orders, including securities Laws, regulations or

securities Laws, regulations or guidances) allow the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure and
oppose with the body initiating the process and, to the extent allowable by Law, to seek limitations on the portion of the
Agreement that is required to be disclosed. In addition, with respect of the required disclosure of a redacted version of this
Agreement pursuant to applicable securities Laws, regulations or guidance, the disclosing Party shall provide the other Party with a
draft of any disclosure it intends to issue at least fifteen (15) Business Days in advance and take into account the other Party’s

Journals”). Commencing with the receipt of such draft Scientific Paper, the receiving Party shall have fifteen (15) Business Days to
notify the sending Party of its observations and suggestions with respect thereto (it being understood that, during such fifteen (15)
Business Days period, no submission for publication thereof shall take place) and the Parties shall discuss these observations and
suggestions. The Party proposing to publish such Scientific Paper shall, in good faith, consider the comments made by the other
Party, particularly if disclosure may be prejudicial to the other Party’s opportunity to obtain any Patent. The other Party may
require that the publication be suspended for a period of time not exceeding sixty (60) days if a Patent may be filed using the Data
or Know How covered in the proposed publication. Neither Party will publish or present any Confidential Information of the other
Party without such other Party’s prior written consent. The sending Party shall provide to the Receiving Party copies of any final
Scientific Paper accepted by a Medical Journal, within ten (10) Business Days after the approval thereof (upon availability and
distribution of such information assuming that providing such information is acceptable taking into consideration the publishers’
need to comply with any healthcare compliance guidelines). To enable free exchange of copyrighted material between the Parties,
each Party agrees that it has or shall (i) obtain and maintain, at its own expense, an annual copyright license or equivalent license
from the copyright clearance center and (ii) list the other Party as a collaborator in an agreement with the copyright clearance
center if required by such agreement.
10.5 Abstracts, Posters and Slide Decks. If a Party (or a Clinical Study site contracted by such Party as sponsor of the
relevant Clinical Study) intends to present findings with respect to a Product at symposia or other meetings of healthcare
professionals, or international and/or US, European or Japanese congresses, conferences or meetings organized by a professional
society or organization (any such occasion, a “Scientific Meeting”), such Party through the JDRC or its designee shall provide to
the other Party, within ten (10) days prior to submission or presentation, as the case may be, copies of (i) all abstracts that will be
submitted for publication (ii) all draft slide presentations for use in oral presentations, and (iii) all posters that will be presented at
such Scientific Meeting, in each case, concerning the Product which have been prepared by or on behalf of one of the Parties, for
submission or presentation. Commencing with the receipt of any such abstract, draft slide presentation or poster, the receiving
Party shall have ten (10) days to inform the sending Party of its observations and suggestions with respect thereto (it being
understood that, during such review period, as applicable, no submission or presentation thereof shall take place) and the Parties
shall discuss these observations and suggestions. The Party proposing to publish such an abstract or make such a presentation
shall, in good faith, consider the comments made by the other Party, particularly if disclosure may be prejudicial to
54[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
the other Party’s opportunity to obtain a Patent. The other Party may require that the abstract or presentation be suspended for a
period of time not exceeding sixty (60) days if a Patent may be filed using the Data or Know-How covered in the proposed
abstract or presentation. A Party shall not publish or present any Confidential Information of the other Party without such other
Party’s prior written consent. The sending Party shall provide to the receiving Party copies of (i) all final abstracts as soon as
reasonably practicable after the approval of the Scientific Meeting, and (ii) all final posters accepted for publication or to be
presented five (5) Business Days prior to the planned publication or presentation thereof (upon availability and distribution of such
information assuming that providing such information is acceptable taking into consideration the publishers’ need to comply with
any healthcare compliance guidelines). The Parties shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to provide the other Party with draft
slide presentations in accordance with the foregoing time periods.
10.6 Registries. Each Party shall be free to (a) register/publish the Clinical Studies they are sponsoring with respect to the
Product, and (b) disclose any Data from such registered Clinical Trials concerning the Product, in each case on ClinicalTrials.gov
or in similar clinical trial registries; provided, however, that the Party proposing to make such disclosure shall have provided the
other Party a copy of the synopsis of the Clinical Study or a detailed description of any other proposed disclosure, as applicable,
that it proposes to have published in such clinical trial registry at least thirty (30) days prior to such registration or disclosure and
shall, in good faith, consider the comments made by the other Party regarding the proposed registration or disclosure and the
protection of any intellectual property contained therein.
10.7  Publicity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.3, the Parties have agreed on a mutual press release
to announce the execution of this Agreement, together with a corresponding Question & Answer outline for use in responding to
inquiries about the Agreement; thereafter, each Party may each disclose to Third Parties the information contained in such press
release and Question & Answer outline without the need for further approval by the other Party. Each Party may also desire to
issue subsequent press releases or other public statements relating to this Agreement or activities hereunder, including information
which pertains to the development and regulatory progress of any Product. Such disclosure may include, without limitation, the
achievement of a milestone and any payments received in respect of such milestone in accordance with applicable Laws, as well as
periodic updates regarding the status of the development and/or regulatory affairs pertaining to such Product. The Parties agree to
consult with each other reasonably and in good faith with respect to the text and timing of such press releases or other disclosures

ARTICLE XI 
PATENT PROSECUTION AND ENFORCEMENT
11.1 Ownership of Inventions.
(a)  Title to all know-how, inventions and other intellectual property made solely by Ono personnel (or that of any Affiliate)
in connection with this Agreement shall be owned by Ono (or its respective Affiliate).
(b) Title to all know-how, inventions and other intellectual property made solely by Array personnel (or that of any
Affiliate) in connection with this Agreement shall be owned by Array (or its respective Affiliate).
(c)  Title to all know-how, inventions and other intellectual property made jointly by personnel of Array (or that of any
Affiliate) and Ono (or that of any Affiliate) in connection with this Agreement shall be jointly owned by Array (or its respective
Affiliate) and Ono (or its respective Affiliate).
(d)  Except to the extent any jointly-owned inventions or intellectual property are included in subject matter
licensed by one Party to the other Party under this Agreement, each Party may only practice any such jointly-owned inventions or
intellectual property for its own internal purposes, and neither Party shall have the right to enforce, license, or assign such jointly-
owned inventions or intellectual property, without the prior written consent of the other Party. The filing, prosecution and
enforcement of Joint Patents is described in Section 11.2(b) below. With respect to the filing, prosecution and enforcement of all
other Patents directed to inventions made jointly by personnel of Array (or that of any Affiliate) and Ono (or that of any Affiliate)
in connection with this Agreement that are not Joint Inventions relating to Binimetinib and Encorafenib and/or Products, the Parties
shall consult with one another and mutually agree upon such actions.
11.2 Prosecution and Maintenance of Array Patents and Joint Patents.
(a)  Prosecution of Array Patents. As between Ono and Array, Array shall, have responsibility for the filing, prosecution
and maintenance of all Array Patents in the Ono Territory at Array’s sole cost and expense. Array agrees to keep Ono generally
informed as to the
56[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
course of such patent filing, prosecution, maintenance or other proceedings with respect to Array Patents. Array shall provide
Ono with copies of each draft patent application with respect to Array Patents (in English, unless Japanese translation is available)
to be filed as well as copies of each office action received from the relevant patent offices in each country of the Ono Territory, in
each case with enough lead time where reasonably practicable, to enable Ono to review and comment on such application or
action; provided that Array shall have no obligation to delay any action or response pending receipt of such comments or
suggestions. Additionally, Array will provide Ono with copies of the patent applications and responses to office actions it ultimately
files with the patent offices in the Ono Territory (in the original language, unless English translation is available). If Array determines
not to file within any jurisdiction requested by Ono, not to continue the prosecution of, or not to continue to maintain or defend,
any Array Patent in any country in the Ono Territory, or if Array otherwise determines to abandon any such Array Patent, Array
shall promptly notify Ono of such determination sufficiently in advance to enable Ono to undertake or continue the prosecution,
maintenance or defense of such Array Patent without a loss of rights, and Ono shall have the right to undertake or continue such
prosecution, maintenance or defense at its sole cost and expense. Ono shall hold all information disclosed to it under this Section
11.2 as confidential.
(b)  Prosecution of Joint Patents. Prior to preparation and filing of any Joint Patent, the Parties shall consult with one
another and mutually agree upon a lead Party to file, prosecute and maintain such Joint Patent under the names of both Array and
Ono. The Joint Patents shall be prepared and prosecuted by a mutually acceptable patent law firm and allocation of costs for
preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance shall be agreed by the Parties prior to preparation and filing of such Joint Patent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may elect not to support the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all or part of any
Joint Patent in any country in the world.
(c) Patent Term Extensions. Array shall have the right, in consultation with Ono with respect to Array Patents, and Ono
shall have the right, with respect to any Patents owned or Controlled by Ono, its Affiliates or Sublicensees related to the Product,
to file all applications and take actions necessary to obtain patent term extensions, or similar additional or supplemental protection,
with respect to the Product under statutes in any other country within the Ono Territory, which extensions shall be owned by the
Party that owns or Controls the underlying Patent. If such Party declines to pursue such patent term extensions, then the other
Party shall have the right on behalf of such Party to file all such applications and take all such actions necessary to obtain such
patent term extensions (or similar additional or supplemental protection) with respect to the Product. In each case, the Parties shall
fully cooperate to obtain such extensions and additional protection.
57[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
11.3 Enforcement.
(a)  Enforcement Actions.
(i) In the event that Array or Ono becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation of any Array
Patent or Array Know-How in any country within the Ono Territory by the Manufacture or sale or use of an unauthorized version
of a Product (“Infringing Product”), then such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing and the Parties shall consult with
each other with respect to the strategy in response to such Infringing Product. Array shall have the first right, but not the obligation,
to initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action in Ono Territory, at its own expense, against any such Third Party. If Array
does not initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action within ninety (90) days of receipt of a request by Ono to initiate an
enforcement proceeding, or if a legal proceeding must be commenced prior to the end of such ninety(90) day period to avoid a
loss of rights, then no later than five (5) days prior to such deadline, then Ono shall be entitled to initiate infringement proceedings
or take other appropriate action against an Infringing Product at its own expense. The Party conducting such action (“Enforcing
Party”) shall have full control over its conduct, including settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Enforcing Party may not
settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner that would materially adversely
affect the rights or interests of the other Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. In any event, the Parties shall assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at Enforcing Party’s
reasonable request.
(ii) With respect to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, Ono’s rights under Section 11.3(a)(i) are subject to the rights
previously granted to AstraZeneca AB (“AZ”) pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of that certain Collaboration and License
Agreement between Array and AZ, effective as of December 18, 2003, as amended by that certain Amendment to Collaboration
and License Agreement, between Array and AZ, effective as of June 1, 2009 (collectively, the “ AZ Agreement”). For the
avoidance of doubt, the rights granted to or retained by Array pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of the AZ Agreement shall, to
the extent relating to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, be subject to this Agreement, including this Section 11.3. Any
enforcement actions initiated by AZ with respect to an Infringing Product shall be deemed initiated by Array for purposes of
Section 11.3(a)(i), and the costs and expenses incurred by Array in such enforcement action shall include any costs and expenses
reimbursed or required to be reimbursed by Array to AZ in accordance with the AZ Agreement in such enforcement action.
Additionally it is further understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the AZ Agreement, and the
rights granted to AZ thereunder, shall in no event constitute a breach of Sections 8.2 and 15.1.
(iii) With respect to the responsibility and allocation of costs for the enforcement of the Joint Patents (i) against Third Party
products that infringe the Joint Patents outside the Ono Territory, or (ii)
58[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
against Third Party products in the Ono Territory that infringe the Joint Patents but that are not “Infringing Products”, the Parties
shall discuss and agree at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such enforcement action in response to
such Third Party infringement.
(b) Recovery.
(i)  Array and Ono shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys’ fees), or equitable
proportions thereof, associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to Section 11.3(a) (i) or (ii) above or
settlement thereof from any resulting recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be allocated as
follows: (i) if Ono initiated such litigation, [ * ] of such excess amount shall be retained by Ono and [ * ] by Array, and (ii) if Array
initiated such litigation, Array shall retain [ * ] of such excess amount and Ono shall obtain [ * ]  of such excess amount, to the
extent such excess amount represents damages relating to Manufacture or sale or use of an Infringing Product in the Ono Territory.
(ii) With respect to enforcement actions against infringers relating to Joint Patents undertaken pursuant to 11.3(a)(iii) above,
the Parties shall discuss and agree in good faith at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such
enforcement action in response to such Third Party infringement.
(c)  Cooperation. The Parties shall keep one another informed of the status of their respective activities regarding any
litigation or settlement thereof concerning the Array Patents or the Array Know-How within the Ono Territory, and shall assist one
another and cooperate in any such litigation at the other’s reasonable request (including joining as a party plaintiff to the extent
necessary and requested by the other Party).
11.4 Third Party Infringement Claims.
(a) If the production, sale or use of any Product in the Ono Territory pursuant to this Agreement results in a claim,
suit or proceeding alleging patent infringement against Array and/or Ono (or their respective Affiliates, licensees or Sublicensees)
(collectively, “Infringement Actions”), the Party subject to such claim, suit or proceeding (“Subject Party”) shall promptly notify the
other Party hereto in writing and shall discuss with the other Party the strategy for defending such Infringement Actions but shall
have the right to direct and control the defense thereof in its sole discretion and at its own expense, with counsel of its choice;
provided, however, the other Party may participate in the defense and/or settlement thereof, at its own expense with counsel of its
choice. In any event, the Subject Party agrees to keep the other Party hereto reasonably informed of all material developments in
connection with any such Infringement Action. Ono agrees not to settle such Infringement Action, or make any admissions or
assert any position in such Infringement Action, in a manner that would adversely affect the allegedly infringing Product
59[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
or the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product in any country of the world, without the prior written consent of Array; and Array
agrees not to settle such Infringement Action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such Infringement Action, in a
manner that would adversely affect the allegedly infringing Product, or the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product, within the
Ono Territory, without the prior written consent of Ono, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
ARTICLE XII  
TRADEMARKS
12.1 Display.
(a)  All packaging materials, labels and Marketing Materials for the Products shall display the Product Trademarks in
katakana or in other applicable language and no other product-specific trademarks or branding.
(i) Products Containing Binimetinib. Where possible, Ono shall utilize “mektovi” as the Product Trademark for Products
containing Binimetinib. If the use of “mektovi” is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties’
reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono shall utilize “balimek” as such Product Trademark is such
country or countries. If neither “mektovi” not “balimek” can be used (or if it is not advisable to use them) for legal, regulatory or
other material reasons outside the Parties’ reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an
alternative Product Trademark reasonably acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being
referred to the JCC for resolution, it being understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the
creation of a single brand for Products containing Binimetinib in countries where neither “balimek” or “mektovi” can be used.
(ii) Products Containing Encorafenib. Where possible, Ono shall utilize “braftovi” as the Product Trademark for Products
containing Encorafenib. If the use of “braftovi” is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties’
reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an alternative Product Trademark reasonably
acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being referred to the JCC for resolution, it being
understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the creation of a single brand for Products containing
Encorafenib in countries where “braftovi” cannot be used.
(b) Each Product shall be sold in the Ono Territory under the trade name Ono or other trade name chosen by Ono and the
logo of Ono; provided, however that to the extent permissible under applicable Law within the Ono Territory, such packaging
materials, labels and Marketing Materials shall also display the trade name of Array in reasonable size and prominence,
60[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
as reasonably approved by Array. The trademarks of Ono, trade dress, style of packaging and the like with respect to the
Product in the Ono Territory may be determined by Ono in a manner that is consistent with Ono’s standard trade dress and style,
but shall be subject to the approval by the JCC to ensure the same are consistent with Array’s global trademark guidelines.
12.2 Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, following registration of the Product
Trademark(s) by Array in the Ono Territory pursuant to Section 12.3 below, Array shall assign, and shall cause its Affiliates to
assign, to Ono all rights to the Product Trademark(s) so registered in the Ono Territory at Ono’s cost and expense, in each case
solely for the purpose of Commercializing the Products in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement. Ono shall be
responsible for maintenance of such Product Trademark(s) at its cost and expense in the Ono Territory.
12.3 Registration of Trademarks and Trade Dress.
(a)  Products Containing Binimetinib. If the Product Trademark for Products containing Binimetinib is balimek or mektovi,
Array (or its designee) shall use Diligent Efforts to file and register at Array’s expense and in its own name (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law), appropriate registrations for such Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory. If, however, neither balimek nor
mektovi is available or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono’s expense and name,
appropriate registrations for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(i)) in such country or
countries of the Ono Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name,
appropriate registrations for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.
(b) Products Containing Encorafenib. If the Product Trademark for Products containing Encorafenib is braftovi, Array (or
its designee) shall use Diligent Efforts to file and register at Array’s expense and in its own name (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law), appropriate registrations for such Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory. If, however, braftovi is not available
or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono’s expense and name, appropriate registrations
for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(ii)) in such country or countries of the Ono
Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name, appropriate registrations
for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.
12.4 Approval of Packaging and Promotional Materials. The Parties agree that the quality of the Products packaging shall
be consistent with the highest standards of quality in the pharmaceuticals industry.
(a)  Mektovi/Balimek/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array’s legal rights
in the balimek or mektovi Product Trademarks,
61[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
Ono shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the balimek or mektovi Product
Trademarks and/or Array’s trade name to Array for Array’s review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change
or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business
Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array’s approval will be deemed to have been
received.
(b) Braftovi/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array’s legal rights in the
braftovi Product Trademark, Ono shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the braftovi
Product Trademark and/or Array’s trade name to Array for Array’s review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change
or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business
Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array’s approval will be deemed to have been
received.
(c)  Other. With respect to all Product Trademarks other than balimek, mektovi or braftovi, Ono shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates and Sublicensees to, comply with trademark style and usage standards approved by Array from time to time
in connection with use of the Product Trademark(s). Ono shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at its own expense, submit
representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying such Product Trademarks to Array for approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that Array reasonably objects to a proposed usage of the
Product Trademark(s), it shall give written notice of such objection to Ono within sixty (60) days of receipt of such sample,
specifying the way in which such usage of its Product Trademark(s) fails to meet the style, usage or quality standards for the
Product or Product Trademark set forth in the first two sentences of this Section 12.4(c). If Ono or its Affiliate wishes to use such
representative Marketing Materials, it must remedy the failure and submit further samples to Array’s for approval.
12.5 Enforcement.
(a)  If either Party becomes aware of any actual or threatened infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono
Territory, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing. Ono shall, at its own expense, initiate infringement proceedings
or take other appropriate actions against an infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono Territory and/or to defend any
actions or proceedings involving the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory, as the case may be. Ono shall have full control over
the conduct of such action, including settlement thereof;
62[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
provided, however, Ono may not settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner
that would materially adversely affect the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory nor the rights or interests of Array, without the
prior written consent of Array, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, the Ono shall keep Array
informed of the status of its activities regarding any litigation in the Ono Territory involving a Product Trademark or settlement
thereof and Array shall assist Ono and cooperate in any such litigation at Ono’s reasonable request and expense.
(b) Ono and Array shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses, or proportionate percentages thereof,
associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to this Section 12.5 or settlement thereof from any resulting
recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be [ * ] between Ono and Array, to the extent such
recovery represents damages pertaining to the infringement of a Product Trademark in the Ono Territory.
12.6 Domain Names. Array shall own rights to, and shall be responsible, at its own expense, for registering and
maintaining, the Internet domain names listed on Exhibit 12.6 (each of the foregoing, a “Domain Name”) and agrees to grant, and
hereby grants to Ono a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Domain Names which Ono elects to use
(and actually uses) in connection with Ono's commercialization of the Product in the Ono Territory in accordance with this
Agreement. In the event Ono would like to use an available Internet domain name including the balimek, mektovi or braftovi, or
Product Trademarks not previously registered to Array, Array grants Ono its consent to register and maintain such Internet domain
names in Ono’s name and at Ono’s expense, provided that upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement, Ono shall
transfer full and exclusive ownership and control of such Internet domain names to Array, or if Array so requests, promptly
withdraw registration of such Internet domain name(s), in each case at Ono’s sole cost and expense. Each Party shall own rights to
any Internet domain names incorporating the Product Trademark(s) owned by such Party under Section 12.1 or any variation or
part of such Product Trademark(s) as its URL address or any part of such address, and agrees to grant, and hereby grants to the
other Party a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Internet domain names which the grantee Party
elects to use (and actually uses) in connection with the grantee Party’s commercialization of the applicable Product in the grantee
Party’s Territory in accordance with this Agreement. The use rights granted to the Internet domain names under this Section 12.6
are limited to the grantee Party’s Territory, and neither Party shall actively make or authorize any use, direct or otherwise, of its
Internet domain names outside its respective territory. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Internet domain names and
the goodwill pertaining to such Internet domain names shall belong exclusively to the Party owning such Internet domain name, who
shall be registered as “Registrant” or “Owner” and as “Administrative Contact” of the relevant domain name. The Parties agree
that any use of a Product Trademark in any content describing or referring to a Product: (i) on any internet page or web site
operated by Array in
63[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
the Array Territory shall be in the sole control of Array, and (ii) on any internet page or web site operated by Ono in the Ono
Territory, subject to the terms of this Agreement, shall be in the sole control of Ono, and therefore Ono and Array, respectively,
shall be responsible for any damage caused to the Product Trademarks as a result of their use of the Product Trademarks on any
internet page or web site in their respective territories.

with respect to such Product expires, at which time this Agreement shall expire in its entirety with respect to such Product in such
country. Upon expiration of this Agreement, the licenses granted to Ono under Section 2.1 shall become non-exclusive, fully paid-
up, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free licenses, with sublicensing rights, to Develop, Manufacture, and/or Commercialize the
Products in the Ono Territory. From and after the expiration of this Agreement, Ono shall have the exclusive, fully paid up, royalty-
free right to use (i) Product Trademarks assigned to Ono under Section 12.2, and (ii) those Domain Names licensed to Ono under

Binimetinib Product in the Ono Territory, or (ii) [ * ] of the First Commercial Sale of the Encorafenib Product in the Ono Territory,
Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, for any reasons by giving [ * ] advance written notice to Array which shall be
accompanied by the rationale for such termination.

shall have materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its material obligations hereunder, and such default shall
have continued for ninety (90) days (or with respect to any breach of any payment obligations, for sixty (60) days) after written
notice thereof was provided to the breaching Party by the non‑breaching Party. Any such termination shall become effective at the
end of such ninety (90) day period (or sixty (60) day period with respect to any failure to pay) unless the breaching Party has
cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period. Exercising the right to terminate this
Agreement by a Party pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall not preclude a claim or a compensation for damages on the other Party.

court of competent jurisdiction; (b) if a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy is filed in any court of competent jurisdiction
against such other Party and such petition is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after filing; (c) if such other Party shall make or

(a)  Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, on a Product-by-Product basis, for Safety Reasons upon thirty
(30) days written notice to Array or within a shorter period if required under applicable Law, but only after consulting with Array
and obtaining Array’s agreement with Ono’s assessment with respect to such Safety Reasons (or as provided for below, the
agreement of the Experts). Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for Efficacy Reasons upon one hundred and eighty
(180) days written notice to Array.
(b) If Array disagrees with Ono’s assessment with respect to Safety Reasons, such matter shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 17.2, which shall apply mutatis mutandis, which Experts shall determine whether the
Safety Reasons are justified and are unlikely to be reversed, within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable
level of investment. The opinion of the majority of the Experts shall be finally binding on the Parties.
(c)  “Safety Reasons” shall mean that, based upon all relevant scientific data, there are safety and public health issues
relating to the Product such that the medical benefit/risk ratio of such Product is sufficiently unfavorable as to materially
compromise the welfare of patients so that the use in patients is no longer justifiable and that such issues are unlikely to be
reversed within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable level of investment.
(d) “Efficacy Reasons” shall mean that either (i) there is no efficacy or lower efficacy of the Products in comparison with
control arm in COLUMBUS Clinical Study as well as BEACON Clinical Study (neither triplet therapy nor doublet therapy
demonstrates statistically significant efficacy in comparison with control arm), or (ii) as of the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date,
neither BRAF-mutant Melanoma and Marketing Approval nor BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer have received Marketing
Approval from MHLW.

separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
14.1 Accrued Obligations. The expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not release either Party
from any liability which, at the time of such expiration or termination, has already accrued to the other Party or which is attributable
to a period prior to such expiration or termination, nor will any termination of this Agreement preclude either Party from pursuing
all rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement, or at law or in equity, with respect to breach of this Agreement.
14.2 Rights on Termination of Agreement. In case of termination of this Agreement by either Party, this Section 14.2 shall
apply:
(a)  Wind-down.
(i) Development. In the event Ono is the sponsor of or conducting any on-going Clinical Studies of the Product following
the date a notice of termination has been issued by Array or Ono, to the extent requested by Array, Ono agrees to: (A) continue to
sponsor or conduct any such Clinical Studies in normal course if such Clinical Studies can be completed (i) within [ * ] following
the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, or (ii) within [ * ]  following the
effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party, or (B) promptly transition to
Array or its designee such sponsorship or Clinical Studies (or portions thereof) provided that in such case, Array shall take over
such studies (i) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2,
or (ii) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party.
In addition, in the event Ono is conducting any on-going pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies (e.g., stability studies) of the
Product, Ono agrees to promptly transition to Array or its designee such pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies to the
extent such transfer is reasonably possible. In the case of a termination by Array pursuant to Section 8.2, 13.3 or 13.4 or by Ono
pursuant to Section 13.2, Ono shall be responsible for (1) costs of carrying out the transfers described in this Section 14.2(a)(i),
and (2) all costs of on-going Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period (including for clarity, the costs
incurred by Array in carrying out any transferred Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period). In all other
cases Array shall be responsible for such costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Ono terminates this Agreement with respect to a
Product pursuant to Section 13.5(a), Ono shall not be obligated to continue to sponsor or conduct any Clinical Studies with
respect to such Product under Section 14.2(a)(i)(A) above.
(ii) Commercialization. To avoid disruption in the availability of Product to patients, if this Agreement is terminated after the
First Commercial Sale of the Product in the Ono Territory other than pursuant to Section 13.5, then to the extent requested by
Array, Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall continue to distribute (but shall not be obligated to market or promote) the
Product, in accordance
66[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in each country of the Ono Territory for which Marketing Approval therefor has
been obtained, taking into account applicable issues, if any, for patient safety or the requirements of a Regulatory Authority within
the Ono Territory, until the date on which Array notifies Ono in writing that Array has secured an alternative distributor or licensee
for the Product in such country, but in no event more for than (A) [ * ]  after the date of such notice of termination of this
Agreement by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2 or by Array pursuant to Section 13.4 or (B) [ * ] after the date of such notice of
termination of this Agreement by Array pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 13.3 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4 (“Wind-
down Period”); provided that Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall cease such activities, or any portion thereof, in a given
country upon sixty (60) days’ notice by Array requesting that such activities (or portion thereof) be ceased. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, during the Wind-down Period, Ono’s and its Affiliates’ and, subject to Section 14.2(a)(viii)
below, Sublicensees’ rights with respect to the Product (including the Product Trademarks) in the Ono Territory shall be non-
exclusive and, without limiting the foregoing, Array shall have the right to engage one or more other distributor(s) and/or licensee(s)
of the Product in all or part of the Ono Territory. Any Product sold or disposed by Ono, its Affiliates and, subject to Section
14.2(a) (viii) below, its Sublicensees in the Ono Territory during the Wind-down Period shall be subject to royalties under Section
6.3 above, provided that in the event of a termination by Ono pursuant to 13.3 or 13.4, if Array requests that Ono continue
distributing the Product beyond the first anniversary of the date on which such notice of termination was given, then, the royalties
owed by Ono under Section 6.3 above with respect to sales of Product occurring during the remainder of the Wind-down Period
shall be reduced by [ * ] of the otherwise applicable royalty rate, provided further that in no event shall such royalties be reduced
to less than the royalty due to [ * ] pursuant to that certain agreement dated [ * ]. Within thirty (30) days of expiration of the Wind-
down Period, Ono shall notify Array of any quantity of the Product remaining in Ono’s inventory and Array shall have the option,
upon notice to Ono, to purchase any such quantities of unlabeled and unpackaged Product from Ono at the price equal to the
price paid by Ono for such quantities of unlabeled and unpackaged Product manufactured by a Third Party manufacturer or, to the
extent Ono manufactured such quantities of unlabeled and unpackaged Products itself, the cost of direct materials and direct labor
for such unlabeled and unpackaged Products.
(iii) Assignment of Regulatory Filings and Marketing Approvals. Ono shall assign (or cause to be
assigned) to Array or its designee, at Array’s cost, except in case of termination by Array pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4 or by
Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, in which case the expenses will be borne by Ono, (or to the extent not so assignable, Ono shall
take all reasonable actions to make available to Array or its designee the benefits of) all Regulatory Filings for the Product in the
Ono Territory, including any such Regulatory Filings made or owned by its Affiliates and/or Sublicensees. In each case, unless
otherwise required by any applicable Law or regulation or requested by Array, the foregoing assignment (or availability) shall be
made within a period of time agreed upon and consistent

Ono Know-How pertaining to the Product in the Ono Territory to the extent not previously provided to Array and Array shall
have a fully-paid-up right to use and disclose all Data and Ono Know-How pertaining to the Product following termination of this
Agreement, except in case of termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4, in which case the Section 14.2(a)(ix) shall
apply. In addition, all such Data and Ono Know-How, to the extent solely related to the Product, shall be deemed Confidential
Information of Array and not Confidential Information of Ono (and will not be subject to the exclusions under Sections 10.1(a) or
(e) above).
(iv) Transition. Each Party shall use Diligent Efforts to cooperate with the other and/or its designee to
effect a smooth and orderly transition in the Development, sale and ongoing marketing, promotion and commercialization of the
Product in the Ono Territory during the Wind-down Period and to conduct in an expeditious manner any activities to be conducted
under this Section 14.2. Without limiting the foregoing, Ono shall, upon written request from Array, provide Array copies of
customer lists, customer data and other customer information relating to the Product in the Ono Territory (except as prevented by
the applicable Laws and regulations relating to the protection of personal information), which Array shall have the right to use and
disclose. For clarity, “customers” means prescribers and individuals and entities with the ability to influence use of the Product (e.g.
individuals responsible for hospital formularies and/or making purchasing decisions on behalf of the hospital) that are called on by
Ono representatives when detailing the Product.
(v) Licenses. Effective as of the date of expiration, Ono shall grant to Array a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to grant sublicenses, (A) under any Improvements, and (B) under any other Patents
owned or Controlled by Ono related to any Product(s) (including without limitation, Ono’s interest in any Joint Patents) for the
purposes of making, using, developing, importing, selling, distributing, marketing and promoting the Product(s) in the form they
exist as of the time the Agreement is terminated, Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a termination by Ono pursuant
Section 13.3 or 13.4, Section 14.2(a)(ix) shall apply.
(vi) Return of Materials. Within ninety (90) days after the end of the Wind-down Period, upon request
by Array, Ono shall either deliver to Array or destroy all tangible items comprising, bearing or containing trademarks of Array
(including the Product Trademarks), trade names, patents, copyrights, designs, drawings, formulas or other Data, photographs,
samples, literature, sales and promotional aids (“Product Materials”) and Confidential Information of Array, that is in Ono’s
possession, subject to Ono’s right to keep one (1) copy for archiving purposes. Effective upon the end of the Wind-down Period,
Ono shall cease to use all trademarks and trade names of Array (including the Product Trademarks) in the Ono Territory, and all
rights granted to Ono hereunder with respect to the Product in the Ono Territory shall terminate.

separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
(vii) Marks and Domains. Effective upon the effective date of termination, Ono hereby assigns and
shall cause to be assigned to Array all worldwide rights in and to (i) any Product Trademarks specific to one or more Products that
Ono or any of its Affiliates used in connection with Product(s), and (ii) all Internet domain names incorporating the applicable
Product Trademark(s) or any variation or part of such Product Trademark(s) as its URL address or any part of such address, for
domains outside the Array Territory. It is understood that such assignment shall not include the name of Ono or any of its Affiliates,
nor the corporate logo, service mark, or trademark for Ono or for any of its Affiliates as a corporate entity.
(viii) Sublicensees. Any contracts with Sublicensees in the Ono Territory engaged by Ono shall, at
the request of Array in its discretion, be assigned to Array to the furthest extent possible; provided that such assignment is
accepted by the Sublicensee(s) in any country or countries within the Ono Territory. In the event such assignment is not requested
by Array or is not accepted by such Sublicensee(s), then the rights of such Sublicensees with respect to the Product in relevant
country or countries within the Ono Territory shall terminate upon the termination of Ono’s rights with respect to the Ono Territory.
Subject to Ono’s Affiliates’ and Sublicensees’ obligations under Section 14.2(a)(ii) above, Ono shall ensure that its Affiliates and
such Sublicensees (if not assigned to Array pursuant to this Section 14.2(a)(viii)) shall transition all rights in and to the Product
back to Array in the manner set forth in this Section 14.2 as if such Affiliate or Sublicensee were named herein.
(ix) Following a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4, in the event that Array wishes
to have Ono: (A) assign to Array the Regulatory Filings for the Product in the Ono Territory and provide to Array a copy of all
Data and Ono Know-How pertaining to the Product as described in 14.2(a)(iii) above, and/or (B) grant to Array a non-exclusive
license under any Improvements, and/or under any other Patents owned or Controlled by Ono related to any Product(s) (including
without limitation, Ono’s interest in any Joint Patents) as described in 14.2(a)(v) above, Array shall so notify Ono and Ono shall
make such rights for consideration consistent with then-prevailing market conditions, on customary terms and conditions to be
negotiated in good faith. In the event that the Parties cannot finalize such an agreement within sixty (60) days of commencing
negotiations with respect thereto, the agreement shall be referred for resolution pursuant to Section 17.3 applied mutatis
mutandis to such agreement.
14.3 Liquidated Damages. In the event that Array (a) [ * ] during [ * ], or (b) intentionally conceals or falsifies a material
result and/or material item of data concerning the safety or efficacy of the Product, which concealment or falsification (i) is
undertaken to induce Ono to not terminate this Agreement and (ii) results in a substantial reduction to the value of the Product in
the Ono Territory, then, as an alternative to its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.3 above, Ono may in its
discretion elect to continue this Agreement, in which case (A) Ono shall be relieved of its due diligence obligations under this
Agreement; and (B) as liquidated damages for the breaches described

Commercialization or use of the Products or (B) could reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA, the PMDA or any
other Regulatory Authority to invoke its policy respecting “Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal
Gratuities”, set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) and any amendments thereto or any analogous laws or policies
in the Ono Territory, with respect the Development, Manufacture, Commercialization or use of Products; and

16.1 Indemnification of Array. Ono shall indemnify and hold harmless each of Array, its Affiliates and the directors, officers
and employees of such entities and the successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (the “Array Indemnitees”), from and against
any and all liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, costs, expenses (including, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other expenses of
litigation) (“Liabilities”) from any claims, actions, suits or proceedings brought by a Third Party (a “Third Party Claim”) incurred by
any Array Indemnitee, arising from, or occurring as a result of: (a) the use, marketing, distribution, importation or sale of any
Product by Ono, its Affiliates or Sublicensees in the Ono Territory, including any Products Liability Claim arising therefrom; (b)
injury or death of patients participating in any Clinical Studies conducted by or on behalf of Ono anywhere in the world, including
any Products Liability Claim arising therefrom, (c) injury or death of patients participating in Clinical Studies conducted under any
Joint Development Plan and sponsored by or on behalf of Ono, including any Products Liability Claim arising therefrom, and (d)
any breach of any representations, warranties or covenants by Ono in Article 15 above; except to the extent such Third Party
Claims result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Array Indemnitee.
16.2 Indemnification of Ono. Array shall indemnify and hold harmless each of Ono, its Affiliates and Sublicensees and the
directors, officers and employees of Ono, its Affiliates and Sublicensees and the successors and assigns of any of the foregoing
(the “Ono Indemnitees”), from and against any and all Liabilities from any Third Party Claims incurred by any Ono Indemnitee,
arising from, or occurring as a result of: (a) the use, marketing, distribution. importation or sale of any Product by Array, its
Affiliates or licensees in the Array Territory (or following termination of this Agreement, anywhere in the world), including any
Products Liability Claim; (b) injury or death of patients participating in any Clinical Studies conducted by or on behalf of Array
anywhere in the world, including any Products Liability Claim arising therefrom, (c) injury or death of patients participating in
Clinical Studies conducted under any Joint Development Plan and sponsored by or on behalf of Array, including any Products
Liability Claim arising therefrom, and (d) any breach of any representations, warranties or covenants by Array in Article 15 above,
except to the extent such Third Party Claims result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a Ono Indemnitee.
16.3 Procedure. A Party that intends to claim indemnification under this Article 16 (the “Indemnitee”) shall promptly notify
the other Party (the “Indemnitor”) in writing of any Third Party Claim, in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such
indemnification, and the Indemnitor shall have sole control of the defense and/or settlement thereof provided that the Indemnitor
shall keep the Indemnitee regularly informed of the status of the defense of the Third Party Claim and shall take into consideration
the Indemnitee’s reasonable comments thereon. The indemnity arrangement in this
75[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
Section 16.3 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any action with respect to a Third Party Claim, if such settlement is
effected without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. The failure to deliver
written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any action with respect to a Third Party
Claim, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this
Section 16.3, but the omission to so deliver written notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it
may have to any Indemnitee otherwise than under this Section 16.3. The Indemnitee under this Section 16.3 shall cooperate fully
with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any action with respect to a Third Party Claim covered by
this indemnification.
16.4 Allocation. In the event a claim falls with the scope of the indemnity given by each Party, any payments in connection
with such claim shall be apportioned between the Parties in accordance with the degree of fault attributable to each Party.
16.5 Disclaimer of Liability for Consequential Damages. UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREUNDER, IN NO
EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,
OF ANY KIND WHATEVER AND HOWEVER CAUSED, AND WHETHER BASED ON AN ACTION OR CLAIM IN
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN
IF FORESEEABLE OR SUFFERED IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 16.5 IS
INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES UNDER THE
INDEMNITIES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 10, SECTIONS 16.1 AND 16.2 ABOVE; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY IN THE CASE OF GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.
16.6 Recalls. To the extent that: (i) any Regulatory Authority in the Ono Territory issues a directive or order that the
Product be recalled or withdrawn in any country within the Ono Territory; (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction orders a recall or
withdrawal of the Product in any country within the Ono Territory, or (iii) the Parties mutually agree, or a Party reasonably
determines and the JCC or JDRC agrees, that the Product should be recalled or withdrawn voluntarily in any country within the
Ono Territory, the Parties shall recall or withdraw the Product in such country as set forth in this Section 16.6. As between the
Parties, Ono shall control and coordinate all activities that Ono reasonably believes to be necessary in connection with such recall
or withdrawal of the Product in the Ono Territory, including
76[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
making all contact with relevant Regulatory Authorities; provided, however, that Ono shall not take any action with respect to any
such recall without first consulting in good faith with Array and obtaining approval of the JDRC, to the extent practicable, and Ono
shall consider in good faith any comments of Array in connection with any aspect of the management of any such recall. For clarity,
all matters relating to a withdrawal or recall of the Product in the Array Territory shall, as between the Parties, be determined,
controlled and coordinated by Array.
ARTICLE XVII 
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
17.1 Referral to Senior Executives. The Parties recognize that disputes as to certain matters relating to this Agreement may
from time to time arise during the term of this Agreement. Any such dispute which cannot be resolved by good faith negotiations
shall be referred, by written notice from either Party to the other, to the Senior Executives (or their respective designees) for
resolution. The Senior Executives (or their respective designees) shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute through
discussions promptly following such written notice. If the Senior Executives cannot resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days
of such written notice, or either Party concludes that the matter will not be so resolved, then, (a) with respect to disputes or
decisions regarding matters described in Section 17.2(a), the provisions set forth in Section 17.2 shall apply, and (b) with respect
to all other disputes, the provisions of Section 17.3 shall apply. If the Parties should resolve such dispute pursuant to the
procedures in this Section 17.1, a memorandum setting forth their agreement will be prepared and signed by both Parties, if
requested by either Party.
17.2 Resolution of Certain Disputes.
(a)  Application to Certain Disputes. The provisions of this Section 17.2 shall apply with respect to any dispute that has
not been resolved following referral to Senior Executives described in Section 17.1, where such dispute concerns any matter (i) to
be decided by the JDRC or JCC and for which a different means of resolution (e.g., a deciding vote of either Party) is not
specified pursuant to Section 3.5 above, or (ii) that is otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement to be resolved pursuant
to this Section 17.2 (each of the foregoing cases referred to as an “Expert Dispute”).
(b) Resolution by Experts. If the Parties do not reach a mutually acceptable resolution as to an Expert Dispute following
referral to Executive Officers described in Section 17.1, then upon written notice by either Party (an “Expert Resolution Notice”),
the Expert Dispute shall be resolved by a final, binding determination by independent experts in the manner described in this
Section 17.2.
77[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
(c)  Selection of Experts. Each Party shall select an independent Third Party expert who is neutral, disinterested and
impartial, is not affiliated with either Party, has expertise and experience relevant to the specific subject matter of the particular
Expert Dispute, and does not have a conflict of interest, and two experts so elected shall elect the third expert with qualification as
set forth above (the three experts so selected, the “ Experts”). Once the Experts have been selected, each Party shall, in
accordance with mutually agreed timelines and procedures, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days from the selection
of the Experts, provide the Experts and the other Party with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance
of the Expert Dispute and may submit a revised or updated report and position to the Experts as mutually agreed or as determined
by the Experts. If so requested by the Experts, each Party shall make oral submissions to the Experts based on such Party’s
written report delivered pursuant to this Section 17.2(c), and each Party shall have the right to be present during any such oral
submissions.
(d) Determination by the Experts. The Experts shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the last submission of the
written reports and, if any, oral submissions, select one of the Parties’ positions as their final decision, and shall not have the
authority to modify either Party’s position or render any substantive decision other than to so select the position of either Ono or
Array as set forth in their respective written report (as initially submitted, or as revised in accordance with Section 17.2(c), as
applicable). The Parties agree that the decision of the Experts shall be the sole, exclusive and binding remedy between them
regarding any Expert Dispute presented to the Experts, provided that the Experts’ decision with respect to disputes referred to it
pursuant to Section 3.5 shall become the decision of the JDRC on the matter for all purposes of this Agreement. The proceedings
and the decision of the Experts shall not be made public without the joint consent of the Parties and each Party shall maintain the
confidentiality of such proceedings and decision unless each Party otherwise agrees in writing; provided that either Party may
make such disclosures as are permitted for Confidential Information of the other Party under Article 10 above.
(e)  Timetable for Completion in Thirty (30) business days. The Parties shall use, and shall direct the Experts to use,
diligent efforts to resolve any Expert Dispute within thirty (30) Business Days after the selection of the Experts, or if resolution
within thirty (30) Business Days is not reasonably achievable, as determined by the Experts, then as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practicable, provided that the Experts shall resolve the Expert Dispute no later than ninety (90) Business Days after the
selection of the Experts.
17.3 Arbitration. Except with respect to (i) those matters subject to determination by the Experts as provided in Section
17.2, or (ii) any dispute between the Parties concerning the inventorship of intellectual property rights for which either Party may
pursue such remedies as it may deem necessary
78[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
or appropriate, any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) shall be exclusively resolved by
final and binding arbitration as follows:
(a)  Arbitration under the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators according
to the ICC Rules of Arbitration (“Rules”), and the panel of three arbitrators so selected is referred to herein as the “Arbitration
Tribunal.” The seat of the arbitration shall be in Osaka, Japan, if it is demanded by Array, and in New York, NY, USA, if it is
demanded by Ono, with hearings to held in the same location. The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not apply.
(b) Conduct of the proceedings. The language of arbitration shall be English. If so requested by the Arbitration Tribunal,
any documents originally in a language other than English shall be submitted with an English translation. The Arbitration Tribunal
shall have the authority to order document production taking guidance from the applicable rules under the laws of the seat of the
arbitration. If the tribunal orders production of documents, the tribunal shall take guidance from the IBA Rules on the Taking of
Evidence in International Arbitration as current on the dated the commencement of the arbitration. The Parties wish to avoid a
costly and time-consuming discovery exercise. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to appoint one or more experts after
having consulted with the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply to
determine any procedural issues. In particular, but without in any way restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree
that the procedural rules of the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply with respect to document production or
other evidentiary issues, except that all privileges restricting disclosure established under such governing law shall apply and may
be invoked by both Parties
(c)  Time limit for rendering the award. The Parties and the Arbitration Tribunal shall endeavor to complete any arbitration
within twelve (12) months following the full constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal. However, this period is not a deadline and
failure to render an award within them shall not be a ground for annulment of an award.
(d) Decision of the Arbitration Tribunal. Every award shall be binding on the Parties. By submitting the dispute to
arbitration under the Rules, the Parties undertake to carry out any award without delay and shall be deemed to have waived their
right to any form of recourse insofar as such waiver can validly be made. The Parties agree that they can seek recognition and
enforcement of any order and/or award made by the Arbitration Tribunal before any competent court. The Arbitration Tribunal
shall have no authority to award punitive damages or other damages exceeding the damages actually suffered by the prevailing
Party, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the provisions of this Agreement. The
fees and expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal (the translation fee described Section 17.3 (b) shall be
79[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
included) shall be shared equally by the Parties, and each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the
proceeding, in each case unless the Arbitration Tribunal in the award assesses such fees and/or expenses against one of the Parties
or allocates such fees and expenses other than equally between the Parties.
(e)  Confidentiality. The existence and content of the Arbitration proceedings and any rulings or award shall be deemed
Confidential Information of both Parties hereunder and kept confidential by the Parties and members of the Arbitration Tribunal
except (i) where such disclosure is permitted under Article 10 of this Agreement, (ii) to the extent that disclosure may be required
of a Party to fulfil a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings
before a state court or other judicial authority, (iii) with the consent of all Parties made in writing subsequently to this Agreement,
(iii) where needed for the preparation or presentation of a claim or defense in this arbitration, (iv) where such information is
already in the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this clause, or (v) by order of the Arbitration Tribunal upon
application of a Party.
(f)  Non-Disclosure of Communications with Internal Counsel. Notwithstanding any rights to the contrary under applicable
procedural or substantive rules of Law, any communications exchanged between members of each Party’s respective legal
department and directors, employees or agents in connection with any disputes, investigations, administrative or other
proceedings, shall not be requested, produced or otherwise used, to the extent such communications would have been covered by
legal privilege and not disclosable, had these communications been exchanged between such Party and its external attorneys.
(g) Interim Relief. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that it deems appropriate,
whether provisional or final, including but not limited to conservatory relief and injunctive relief, and any such measures ordered by
the Arbitration Tribunal shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the governing law selected by the Parties pursuant to
Section 18.3, be deemed to be a final award on the subject matter of the measures and shall be enforceable as such. Each Party
retains the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional and/or conservatory relief, including injunctions or
temporary restraining orders before or after the constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal, and any such request shall not be deemed
incompatible with the Agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
ARTICLE XVIII

Agreement) by either Party is prevented, restricted, interfered with or delayed by
80[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed

reason of any cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party (including, fire, flood, earthquake, tsunami, embargo, power
shortage or failure, acts of war, insurrection, riot, terrorism, strike, lockout or other labor disturbance, acts of God or any acts,
omissions or delays in acting of the other Party), the Party so affected shall, upon giving written notice to the other Party, be
excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction, interference or delay; provided that the affected Party
shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and shall continue performance with the utmost
dispatch whenever such causes are removed.
18.2 Hardship. Should the occurrence of events not contemplated by the Parties fundamentally after the equilibrium of the
present contract thereby placing an excessive burden on one of the Parties in the performance of its contractual obligations, that
Party may proceed as follows: The party shall make a request for revision within a reasonable time from the moment it become
aware of the event and of its effect on the economy of the present contract. The request shall indicate the grounds on which it is
based. The Parties shall then consult one another with a view to revising the contract an equitable basis, in order to ensure that
neither Party suffers excessive prejudice. The request for revision does not of itself suspend performance of the contract. If the
Parties fail to agree on the revision of the contract within time limit of ninety (90) business days of the request, the contract remains
in force in accordance with its original terms.
18.3 Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions regarding its validity or interpretation, or the breach or
performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of

Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement and are strictly excluded.
18.4 Waiver of Breach. The failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall
in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any condition or term in any one or
more instances shall be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or term or of another condition or term.
18.5 Modification. No amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing
signed by both Parties hereto. No provision of this Agreement shall be varied, contradicted or explained by any oral agreement,
course of dealing or performance or any other matter not set forth in an agreement in writing and signed by both Parties hereto.
18.6 Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a valid, legal and enforceable substitute provision that most nearly reflects the
original intent of the Parties and all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction. Such
invalidity, illegality
81[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
18.7 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement (including the Exhibits attached hereto), together with the
pharmacovigilance agreement specified in Section 4.11(b), the Quality Agreement, and the Supply Agreement (in each case, when
executed) constitute the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, representations and/or understandings, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties

ARTICLE III
DELIVERABLES AND COMPLETION
3.1 Deliverables. Subject to the remedies set forth in Section 3.4, Conformis shall furnish Stryker with the Deliverables
as defined in the R&D Work Plan, and Stryker shall have the opportunity to analyze and test each Deliverable for the purposes of
determining Acceptance as set forth in the R&D Work Plan. Each Deliverable shall be deemed to be completed once such
Deliverable has been Accepted (as defined below).
3.2 Free from Infringement . Without the consent of Stryker, Conformis shall not introduce any structure or
methodology in the Deliverables (including a Deliverable within a Product or a Stryker Product) that (1) raise a colorable
argument of patent infringement in the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of the Deliverable as such Deliverable
8
Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019is intended to be exploited under the Other Agreements, (2) misappropriate any Confidential Information of any Third Party, or
(3) otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party. For clarity, disclosure of a matter on the Disclosure
Schedules to the Asset Purchase Agreement shall not be deemed consent by Stryker under this Section 3.2.
3.3 Completion. After a Deliverable has been furnished to Stryker, Stryker (or its Agent designee) will be entitled to
analyze and test the Deliverable to determine if it operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable
Acceptance Criteria set forth in R&D Work Plan. Conformis shall provide such assistance as Stryker may reasonably request in
such determination. Stryker shall have [**] (“Acceptance Notification Period”) following the date the Deliverable is received by
Stryker to Accept or reject the Deliverable as described in Section 3.4.
3.4 Acceptance or Rejection . Respecting any Deliverable for Milestone #1 or Milestone #2, as set forth below, if
Stryker determines that a Deliverable operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria
pursuant to the R&D Work Plan, then Stryker will notify Conformis in writing that Stryker Accepts such Deliverable. If Stryker
reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not operate in accordance with or otherwise conform to the applicable Acceptance
Criteria, then Stryker will provide Conformis with a written notice of rejection within the Acceptance Notification Period
describing the defect in view of the relevant Acceptance Criteria and including sufficient detail with respect to such Stryker testing
and testing results as Conformis reasonably requests (“Failure Notice”). Conformis shall have [**] (or such longer period of time
as may be agreed between the parties in good faith should the scope and complexity of the applicable Deliverable warrant some
longer period of time) (“Redelivery Period”) following the date it receives the Failure Notice to correct and redeliver the
Deliverable. If Conformis timely delivers a corrected version of the Deliverable within the Redelivery Period, then Stryker will be
9
Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019entitled to repeat its acceptance analysis and testing process for the purposes of determining Acceptance as set forth in the R&D
Work Plan until such Deliverable operates in accordance with or otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria;
provided, however, that if Stryker properly rejects a particular Deliverable three (3) or more times in accordance with this Article
III, or if Conformis fails to deliver a version or corrected version, as the case may be, of the Deliverable within any respective [**]
period, Stryker may, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.2(c) (in the event of such three (3) rejections, Stryker
“Finally Rejects” the Deliverable). Such termination, together with the provisions of Section 5.2 of the License Agreement,
constitutes as Stryker’s sole remedy and Conformis’ exclusive liability in the event of any such rejection or failure by Conformis to
deliver materially conforming Deliverables hereunder so long as such rejection or failure does not arise from Conformis’ fraud,
willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. Stryker shall be deemed to have accepted a Deliverable timely furnished to it
unless (a) the Deliverable fails to operate in accordance with and otherwise conform the applicable Acceptance Criteria, and (b)
Stryker provides Conformis a written Failure Notice within the Acceptance Notification Period in accordance with this Section
3.4 (any acceptance or deemed acceptance, described in this Section 3.4, “Acceptance” or “ Accept”). Acceptance of a
Deliverable shall not constitute a waiver of any rights Stryker may have based on Conformis’ warranties set forth in this
Agreement.
3.5 Payment for Milestones . Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development
work to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:
(a) Milestone #1 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-
Specific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a
total of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and
10

developing or assisting another in developing, or causing another to develop, Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf
Knee Implants for any Third Party in the field of orthopedics until January 1, 2032 (or earlier, to the extent set forth in Section
2.3.3.4 or Section 2.3.5 of the Distribution Agreement), with the exception that Conformis (including any entity involved in a
Change of Control of Conformis, any such entity an “Acquirer”), may develop Patient-Specific Instrumentation for any Off-The-
Shelf Implants of Conformis, an Acquirer or any of their Affiliates. For purposes of clarity, the foregoing does not prevent
Conformis from granting any license, release, covenant not to sue or other immunity to any third party under any Patents, including
any such immunity that would authorize manufacture, use or sale of Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf Knee
Implants outside the Buyer Field.

Improved Stryker Background IP.
(c) All right, title and interest in and to the Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP (“Joint IP”) shall be
owned jointly by the Parties. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Joint IP may be used freely by either Party or

and its Affiliates, on the other hand, within the Buyer Field, in each case, without the consent of, or duty to account to or notify, the
other Party, but, except with respect to external licenses of the Improved Conformis Background IP by Conformis or its Affiliates
to Third Parties, any external Third Party license shall be governed in accordance with the last sentence of Section 4.3(c) of the
APA. Each Party to whom ownership is to vest in Joint IP by operation of law or by assignment by its employees or Agents agrees
to assign and hereby assigns to the other Party an undivided one-half right, title and interest in and to all Joint IP; and to facilitate
such assignment, the Party possessing such ownership agrees (i) to regularly ensure that its employees and consultants timely make
any appropriate assignments to it; and (ii) at the other Party’s reasonable request, to execute and have its employees and
consultants execute, as necessary, all assignments and any other documentation to perfect the undivided one-half right, title and

the extent to which the Joint IP constitutes improvements to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, (2) the
grant by Stryker to Conformis of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Stryker Background IP, or (3) the grant
by either Party of any license or immunity of any kind under any Intellectual Property rights owned by such Party, regardless of

IP), but each Party may assign all of its right, title and interest in and to the Joint IP and Joint IP Rights to an Affiliate or Third Party
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.2.
(e) Conformis shall promptly disclose to Stryker all (i) Improved Stryker Background IP, and (ii) Joint IP. Stryker shall

or to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf or in the name of the other Party or to bind the other Party in any manner
whatsoever.

assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether through a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Party; except that , either Party shall be permitted, without any need for the other Party’s
consent, to assign this Agreement (a) in whole or in part to an Affiliate (provided, however, that once such Person is no longer an
Affiliate of the assigning Party, such former Affiliate shall assign this Agreement back to the assigning Party), provided that the
assigning Party provides the other Party notice of any such assignment provided further that failure to provide such notice of such

of the assigning Party’s business or assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by Change of Control, merger,
sale of assets or otherwise; provided, however, that, with respect to clause (b), (i) any assignment of this Agreement shall be void

this Agreement must be accompanied by a simultaneous assignment of the Other Agreements to the same assignee, and the
assigning Party’s interest in the Purchased Assets to the same assignee unless otherwise agreed by Conformis in advance, which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment in whole or in part shall not relieve the assigning Party of its
obligations hereunder. If and to the extent that a Party assigns any of its rights and/or obligations hereunder in accordance with this
Section 10.2, then this Agreement shall be binding upon the assignee to the same extent as if it were a Party hereto. Any

soon as practicable and shall do everything reasonably possible to resume performance. Upon receipt of such notice, all
obligations under the Agreement shall be immediately suspended. If the period of nonperformance exceeds [**] from the receipt

terminate the Agreement. Any acceptance or warranty period affected by a Force Majeure Event shall likewise be extended for a
period equal to the duration of such Force Majeure Event. As applied to this Section 10.4

Indemnitor shall not have the right to settle or compromise any Claim against the Indemnitee (that the Indemnitor has defended pursuant to this

performance of the obligations on its part contained in this Agreement if and to the extent that such failure or delay is due to

assign this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a Third Party licensee of Achaogen’s rights with respect to Plazomicin. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Any assignment not in accordance
with this Section 13.2 (Assignment) shall be void.
 
13.3 No Waiver. The failure of either Party to require performance by the other Party of any of that other Party’s
obligations hereunder shall in no manner affect the right of such Party to enforce the same at a later time. No waiver by any Party
hereto of any condition, or the breach of any provision, term, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, whether by
conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such

Agreement to be excessive, or invalid, void or unenforceable, the offending term or provision shall be deleted, and, if possible, replaced
by a term or provision which, so far as practicable, achieves the legitimate aims of the Parties. In the event that such provisions cannot
be agreed upon, the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of one or more provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this
Agreement as a whole.
 
13.5 Relationship Between the Parties . Both Parties are independent contractors under this Agreement. Nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to create an employment, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties hereto

Registration with the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) is required to use regulated species of animals for
biomedical purposes. USDA is responsible for the enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et.
seq), http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/awa.htm
The Public Health Service (PHS) Policy is administered by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW)
http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm.  An essential requirement of the PHS Policy,
http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm is that every institution using live vertebrate
animals must obtain an approved assurance from OLAW before they can receive funding from any component
of the U.S. Public Health Service.
The PHS Policy requires that Assured institutions base their programs of animal care and use on the  Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/labrats/ and that they
comply with the regulations (9 C.F.R., subchapter A) http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm
issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Animal Welfare Act. The Guide may differ
from USDA regulations in some respects. Compliance with USDA regulations is an absolute requirement of
this Policy.
The Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)
http://www.aaalac.org is a professional organization that inspects and evaluates programs of animal care
institutions at their request.  Those that meet the high standards are given accredited status.  As of the 2002
revision of the PHS policy, the only accrediting body recognized by PHS is the AAALAC.  While AAALAC
Accreditation is not required to conduct biomedical research, it is highly desirable. AAALAC uses the Guide
as their primary evaluation tool. They also use the  Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in

Subjects
The PHYS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals requires that applicant organizations
proposing to use vertebrate animals file a written Animal Welfare Assurance with the Office for Laboratory
Animal Welfare (OLAW), establishing appropriate policies and procedures to ensure the humane care and use
of live vertebrate animals involved in research activities supported by the PHS.  The PHS Policy stipulates that
an applicant organization, whether domestic or foreign, bears responsibility for the humane care and use of
animals in PHS-supported research activities.  Also the PHS policy defines “animal” as “any live, vertebrate
animal used, or intended for use, in research, research training, experimentation, biological testing or for related
purposes.”  This policy implements and supplements the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and
Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training, and requires that institutions use the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as a basis for developing and implementing an institutional
animal care use program. This Policy does not affect applicable State or local laws or regulations that impose
more stringent standards for the care and use of laboratory animals.  All institutions are required to comply, as
applicable, with the Animal Welfare Act, as amended and other Federal statutes and regulations relating to
animals. These documents are available from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, (301) 496-7163. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm.
No PHYS supported work or research involving vertebrate animals will be conducted by an organization,
unless that organization is operating in accordance with an approved Animal Welfare Assurance and provides
verification that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has reviewed and approved the
proposed activity in accordance with the PHS policy.  Applications may be referred by the PHS back to the
institution for further review in the case of an apparent or potential violations of the PHS policy.  No award to
an individual will be made unless that individual is affiliated with an assured organization that accepts
responsibility for compliance with the PHS Policy. Foreign applicant organizations applying for PHS awards for
activities involving vertebrate animals are required to comply with PHS Policy or provide evidence that
acceptable standards for the humane care and use of animals will be met.  Foreign applicant organizations are
not required to submit IACUC approval, but should provide information that is satisfactory to the Government
to provide assurances for the humane care of such animals.

continuing waiver. Failure of either party to exercise promptly any right, power or privilege granted by this Agreement, or to require strict

made (a) upon delivery, if delivered personally (by courier service or otherwise), as evidenced by written receipt or other written proof of delivery

EL POLLO LOCO® FRANCHISE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT
(Non-exclusive/Exclusive)
THIS FRANCHISE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) dated for identification purposes only as of
_____________________, is made and entered into by and between EL POLLO LOCO, INC., a Delaware
corporation, with its principal place of business at 3535 Harbor Blvd, Suite 100, Costa Mesa, California 92626
(referred to herein as “El Pollo Loco” or “Franchisor”) and __________________an individual, with its principal
place of business at _____________________________________ (“Developer”).
Recitals.
A.Franchisor owns certain proprietary and other property rights and interests in and to the “El Pollo Loco ®”
trademark and service mark, and such other trademarks, service marks, logo types, insignias, trade dress
designs and commercial symbols as Franchisor may from time to time authorize or direct Developer to use in
connection with the operation of a(n) “El Pollo Loco®” restaurant (the “El Pollo Loco® Marks”). Franchisor has a
distinctive plan for the operation of retail outlets for the sale of fire-grilled food items and related products, which
plan includes but is not limited to the El Pollo Loco® Marks and the Operations Manual (the “Manual”), policies,
standards, procedures, employee uniforms, signs, menu boards and related items, and the reputation and
goodwill of the El Pollo Loco® chain of restaurants (collectively, the “El Pollo Loco® System”).
B.Developer represents that it is experienced in and has independent knowledge of the nature and specifics of
the restaurant business. Developer represents that in entering into this Agreement it has relied solely on its
personal knowledge and has not relied on any representations of Franchisor or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents, except those representations contained in any legally required Franchise Disclosure
Document delivered to Developer.
C. Developer desires to obtain development rights for multiple restaurants under the El Pollo Loco ® System
(each, an “El Pollo Loco® Restaurant”) from Franchisor within a specified geographical (the “Territory”) specified
in Exhibit “A” attached hereto and made a part hereof (or if single unit, replace with “Developer desires to
obtain development rights for a single restaurant under the El Pollo Loco® System (each, an “El Pollo Loco®
Restaurant”) from Franchisor within a specified address (the “Territory”) specified in Exhibit “A” attached
hereto and made a part hereof.”)
D.Franchisor is willing to grant the (non-exclusive/exclusive) right to develop and open El Pollo Loco ®
Restaurant(s) within the Territory referenced in Exhibit “A.”
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and obligations herein contained, the parties hereto
agree as follows:
1.Development Rights in Territory.
1.1. Franchisor hereby grants to Developer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement  (if
Section 2.20 is applicable add “, and specifically Section 2.20 hereof,”) and as long as Developer shall not be
in default of this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Developer and
Franchisor, (non-exclusive/exclusive) development rights to establish and operate ____ franchised restaurant(s),
and to use the El Pollo Loco ® System solely in connection therewith, at specific locations to be designated in
separate Franchise Agreement(s) (the “Franchise Agreements”). (If exclusive agreement, add “Developer
expressly acknowledges that the exclusive rights granted herein apply only to the right to develop new
restaurants in the Territory, and no exclusive territory or radius protection for the term of any Franchise
Agreement is granted herein and any such protection shall be set forth in the particular Franchise
Agreement to be signed.”) The Franchise Agreements (and all ancillary documents attached as Exhibits to the
Franchise Agreement, including the Personal Guarantee) executed in accordance with this Agreement shall be in
the form currently in use by Franchisor at the time of execution of the Franchise Agreement and shall be executed
individually by each person, partner, member or shareholder.
1.2. (Only applies if exclusive Agreement. Delete if non-exclusive Agreement.) Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.20 hereof, after the date of this
Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020Agreement and during the term of this Agreement, and so long as Developer is in compliance with its obligations
under this Agreement, Franchisor shall neither, without Developer’s prior written consent: (i) grant development
rights to anyone else with respect to the Territory or any part of the Territory; nor (ii) establish or franchise any
person to establish an El Pollo Loco restaurant under the Marks and System at any location within the Territory.
Franchisor expressly retains all other rights and may, among other things, on any terms and conditions Franchisor
deems advisable, and without granting Developer any rights therein:
a. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate an El Pollo Loco restaurant located
outside of the Territory;
b. Sell the same or similar products (whether or not using the Marks), as will be sold by Developer in a
developed El Pollo Loco restaurant, to customers at any retail location (whether within or outside of the Territory),
through any method or channel of distribution, including, without limitation, at retail locations such as grocery or
convenience stores and via the Internet, telemarketing and direct marketing means, through other non-El-Pollo
Loco restaurants having the same or similar menu items, or through any other distribution channel;
c. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate restaurants (not using the Marks)
having the same or similar menu items whether within or outside of the Territory; and
d. Any continued operation by Franchisor, or the allowance of any continued operation by a franchisee of
Franchisor, of an El Pollo Loco restaurant within the Territory which was opened on or before the date of this
Agreement shall not be considered to constitute a breach of this Agreement.
1.3. (Only applies to multi-unit Development Agreement - delete if single-unit Development
Agreement). Prior to or concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Developer shall meet with Franchisor’s
development representatives and prepare a market development plan for the units to be constructed and opened
by Developer in the Territory (identifying specific key areas, key intersections and trade areas in the Territory) and
all development pursuant to this Agreement shall be in accordance with this plan (the “Market Plan”). The Market
Plan shall include proposed areas where sites may be located, ranking and prioritization of site locations and
other information customarily used by market planners in the restaurant industry. Developer and Franchisor shall
jointly approve the Market Plan.
2. Limitation on Development Rights.
2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase
agreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco ® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each
calendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto and
made a part hereof.
2.2. For purposes of the Development Schedule in Exhibit “B”, no credit will be given for the development
of El Pollo Loco ® Restaurant(s) outside the Territory, regardless of the fact that Developer may, upon proper
application, obtain from Franchisor an El Pollo Loco ® Franchise Agreement (“Franchise Agreement”) for any
such development.
2.3. Although this Agreement affords the Developer the right to develop and open El Pollo Loco ®
restaurant(s) within the Territory, as set forth on Exhibit “A”, all Restaurant(s) developed under this Agreement
must be duly licensed through individual Franchise Agreement(s). Developer will execute El Pollo Loco’s then
standard Franchise Agreement in use at the time of execution for each restaurant developed under this
Agreement, and agrees to pay Franchisor the current fees, royalties and other required payments in accordance
with the Franchise Agreement and Franchise Disclosure Document then in effect. Execution of the appropriate
Franchise Agreement and payment of the initial franchise fee and/or any other required fees must be
accomplished prior to the commencement of construction at any site.
2.4. Developer must satisfy all Franchisor’s financial and operational criteria then in effect and in addition, if
Developer is also a Franchisee of one or more El Pollo Loco Restaurants, Franchisee must also be in good
standing with Franchisor and satisfy all Franchisor’s financial and operational criteria then in effect prior to El Pollo
Loco's execution of each standard Franchise Agreement issued pursuant to this Agreement. Developer shall
provide Franchisor with current information pertaining to Developer's financial condition and the financial condition
of the majority and managing members/partners/shareholders of Developer at any time upon El Pollo Loco's
request and in no event less than once annually. Developer acknowledges that, among other things, it will be
Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020required to submit annual financial statements of Developer and personal financial statements of each of its
principal owners and Managing Members to be eligible for financial approval by El Pollo Loco. In the event any of
the majority owners of Developer shall also be the Managing Members and/or majority owners of any other entity
which is a franchisee of El Pollo Loco, then each such franchisee entity must be operationally and financially
approved by Franchisor before approval for expansion will be granted to any one franchisee entity. “Managing
Members” shall be any individuals who are designated as the primary decision makers or general managers of
the franchisee entity and those individuals who (individually or collectively) own at least 51% interest in the
franchisee entity.
2.5. Developer shall use its best efforts to retain qualified real estate professionals (including licensed
brokers) to locate proposed sites for the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s). Developer shall submit proposed sites for
each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant unit to be developed under this Agreement for acceptance by Franchisor’s Real
Estate Site Approval Committee (“RESAC”), together with such site information as may be reasonably required
by Franchisor to evaluate the proposed site, no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit “B” as RESAC Submittal
Dates, the first of which shall be approximately ninety (90) days after execution of this Agreement. Should the site
be accepted by RESAC, it will be referred to as the “ Approved Site”. Such acceptance will expire one (1) year
from the RESAC approval date. Franchisor may require, as a condition to its approval of a site, a “Market Study”,
which shall include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information and an analysis of
the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants surrounding or
within the vicinity of such proposed site all in such format as the Franchisor may require. All such analyses,
information and studies shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Developer.
2.6. Franchisor shall send representatives to evaluate proposed site(s) for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant
to be developed under this Agreement, and Franchisor will do so at its own expense for the first two (2) proposed
sites for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant. If Developer proposes, and Franchisor evaluates, more than two (2) sites
for each El Pollo Loco ® Restaurant, then Developer shall reimburse Franchisor for the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Franchisor’s representatives in connection with the evaluation of such additional proposed
site(s), including, without limitation, the costs of lodging, travel, meals and wages.
2.7. Provided there exists no default by Developer under this Agreement or any other development,
franchise or other agreement between Franchisor and Developer, Franchisor shall evaluate each site proposed for
which Developer has provided all necessary evaluation information, and shall promptly after receipt of Developer’s
proposal, send to Developer written notice of acceptance or non-acceptance of the sit
2.8. If RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may impact
sales at any company-owned El Pollo Loco® Restaurant, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to accept or
reject the proposed site, without any obligation to discuss a possible resolution with Developer. However,
Franchisor may elect to discuss with Developer a possible resolution with regard to the proposed site; however, if
such an agreement cannot be reached, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to reject the proposed site. If
RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may potentially impact sales
at any existing El Pollo Loco ® franchisee’s restaurant, Franchisor shall notify Developer of the existing El Pollo
Loco® franchisees’ location(s) and contact information. If nevertheless Developer wishes to try to proceed with that
site, Developer must obtain a written waiver from those existing El Pollo Loco ® franchisees of any claims they
might have against Developer and Franchisor with respect to the proposed new El Pollo Loco® Restaurant. Such
waiver, if obtained, must be submitted along with the evaluation information required pursuant to this Section.
2.9. No later than the Site Commitment Dates set forth in Exhibit “B ”, Developer shall submit for the
Approved Site to Franchisor for its review and approval of:
a. A fully negotiated but unexecuted lease, which may only subject to obtaining necessary governmental
permits. The unexecuted form of the lease must be submitted to Franchisor to review for the required terms and
conditions listed in Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below prior to full execution of the lease. Franchisor will
promptly notify Developer upon their approval of the inclusion of such required terms and conditions. Developer
will promptly then provide a final executed copy of the lease to Franchisor; or
b. A purchase agreement. Should Developer purchase the site using another entity other than the franchise
entity, Developer must then enter into a lease with the Franchise entity as the lessee and the purchasing entity as
the lessor and must comply with all the requirements of this Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below).
2.10. Any lease to be entered into by Developer shall include the terms and conditions set forth below and
in a form approved by Franchisor:

b. The term (with renewal options) of the lease must match at least the initial term of the franchise
agreement; and
c. The landlord consents to your use of the premises as an El Pollo Loco® restaurant which will be open
during the required days and hours set out in the Operations Manual.
2.11. Franchisor shall have no liability under any lease or purchase agreement for any El Pollo Loco ®
Restaurant location developed under this Agreement and shall not guarantee Developer’s obligations thereunder.
Upon approval by Franchisor of the form of Developer’s lease and execution of a lease for a site by Developer,
Developer shall furnish to Franchisor a fully executed copy of such lease and any amendments thereto within
fifteen (15) calendar days of such execution. Franchisor shall have no obligation to assist Developer to negotiate
its leases.
2.12. The lease or deed may not contain a non-competition covenant which restricts Franchisor or any
franchisee or licensee of Franchisor, from operating an El Pollo Loco® Restaurant or any other retail restaurant,
unless such covenant is approved by Franchisor in writing prior to the execution by Developer of the lease.
2.13. Each subsequent site to be developed pursuant to the Development Schedule shall be submitted for
approval by RESAC by the date set forth in Exhibit “B”. Similarly, each fully executed lease (executed upon prior
review and approval by Franchisor) or purchase agreement (with all contingencies to Developer’s obligations
waived or satisfied, except permitting contingencies) relating to each subsequent Approved Site shall: (1) be
delivered to Franchisor on or before the Site Commitment Date for each respective El Pollo Loco® Restaurant as
set forth in Exhibit “B” and (2) prior to the execution of your Franchise Agreements (3) prior to the payment of
your initial Franchise Fees for each site and (4) prior to the commencement of construction of the El Pollo Loco®
Restaurant.
2.14. RESAC site approval does not assure that a Franchise Agreement will be executed. Execution of the
Franchise Agreement is contingent upon Developer completing the purchase or lease of the proposed site within
sixty (60) days after approval of the site by the Franchisor or no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit “B” as Site
Committment Dates.
2.15. Developer acknowledges that time is of the essence in this Agreement. If Developer has not obtained
approval and entered into a binding lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) to
be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer shall be in default of its
obligations under the Development Schedule and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies
under this Agreement, up to and including termination of this Agreement.
2.16. Developer also acknowledges that it is required pursuant to this Agreement to open El Pollo Loco®
Restaurants in the future pursuant to dates set forth in the Development Schedule attached as Exhibit “B”. If
Developer fails to meet the opening date for any El Pollo Loco® Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement,
Developer shall be in default and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies available to
Franchisor set forth in Section 11. Developer acknowledges that if Developer fails to open El Pollo Loco ®
Restaurants in a timely manner pursuant to the Development Schedule, Franchisor will suffer lost revenues,
including royalties and other fees which would be difficult to calculate and which Franchisor would have received
had Developer met the agreed schedule or had Franchisor had the right to grant development rights to others in
the Territory.
2.17. Developer acknowledges that the estimated initial investment and estimated expenses set forth in
Items 6 and 7 of our Franchise Disclosure Document are subject to and likely to increase over time, and that future
El Pollo Loco® Restaurants will likely involve a greater initial investment and operating capital requirements than
those stated in the Franchise Disclosure Document provided to you prior to your execution of this Agreement.
2.18. Developer understands and acknowledges that in accepting Developer’s proposed site or by
granting a franchise for each approved site, Franchisor does not in any way, endorse, warrant or guarantee either
directly or indirectly the suitability of such site or the success of the franchise business to be operated by
Developer at such site. The suitability of the site and the success of the franchise business depend upon a number
of factors outside of Franchisor’s control, including, but not limited to, the Developer’s operational abilities, site
location, consumer trends and such other factors that are within the direct control of the Developer.
Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/20202.19. The purpose of this Agreement is to promote orderly incremental growth within the El Pollo Loco ®
System. The acquisition of existing El Pollo Loco ® restaurants by Developer does not represent incremental
growth and, therefore, does not satisfy the terms of this Agreement pertaining to development.
2.20. (To be added where there are existing restaurants in the Territory) Developer acknowledges
that Franchisor (i) is operating or has franchised another to operate, one (1) or more restaurants in the
Territory or (ii) has granted franchise rights to another in the Territory or (iii) approved a new site for
development for those locations identified in Exhibit “C” attached hereto and incorporated herein by this
reference. Developer further acknowledges that Franchisor retains the sole and absolute right to
approve or disapprove any proposed location for development under this Agreement if, in Franchisor’s
reasonable judgment: (i) such proposed location is not suitable for an El Pollo Loco ® Restaurant or (ii)
such proposed location will have a material adverse effect on the profitability of another existing El Pollo
Loco® location (or approved site) in the Territory. Developer covenants to use its reasonable best efforts
to avoid selecting proposed locations that would adversely impact pre-existing locations in the Territory.
3. Development Fee.
3.1. Developer shall pay to Franchisor upon execution of this Agreement a non-refundable Development
Fee (the “Development Fee ”) equal to Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) in immediately available funds, for
each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement. The Development Fee is consideration for
this Agreement. The Development Fee is not consideration for any Franchise Agreement and is non-refundable.
The $20,000 Development Fee for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant shall be applied against the initial franchise fee
payable upon the execution of the Franchise Agreement applicable to such El Pollo Loco ® Restaurant. As a
benefit of signing the Development Agreement, the Initial Fee for the second and each subsequent restaurant
developed under the same Development Agreement will be reduced by us to $30,000. As an example, the Initial
Fee for the first restaurant developed under a Development Agreement would be $40,000 to which $20,000 (from
the Development Fee will be credited. The Initial Fee for the second and remaining restaurants developed under
the same Development Agreement would be $30,000, to which $20,000 from the Development Fee will be
credited. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10 or 11 below, Developer will lose its right to
develop and Development Fee.
4. Term of Development Agreement.
4.1. This Agreement shall commence on the date specified in Exhibit "B". Unless terminated pursuant to
Section 10 or 11 below, it shall expire upon the earlier of the date specified in Exhibit "B" or upon the opening of
the last El Pollo Loco® Restaurant listed in the Development Schedule.
5. Territory Conflicts.
5.1. The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other
franchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the
event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development
agreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial
rights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For
this purpose, Franchisor agrees to approve any such assignment not in conflict with the other terms of this
Agreement, subject to the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, and current policies pertaining to
assignments, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of all past due debts owed to Franchisor and the execution
of a General Release.
5.2. In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El
Pollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the
development of the Territory. However, if it appears to El Pollo Loco, as its sole and absolute right to determine,
that protection of the Territory by legal action is not advisable, whether due to the anticipation of, or the actual
protracted nature of the action, the costs involved, the uncertainty of outcome, or otherwise, Franchisor has the
right to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance, if any, of the Development Fee
made pursuant to Section 3, which has not been applied against the initial franchise fees for Franchise
Agreement(s) to be acquired under this Agreement.
6. Proprietary Rights of El Pollo Loco.
Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/20206.1. Developer expressly acknowledges El Pollo Loco's exclusive right, title, and interest in an to the trade
name, service mark and trademark "El Pollo Loco", and such other trade names, service marks, and trademarks
which are designated as part of the El Pollo Loco® System (the "Marks"), and Developer agrees not to represent
in any manner that Developer has any ownership in El Pollo Loco ® Marks. This Agreement is not a Franchise
Agreement. Developer may not open an El Pollo Loco® Restaurant or use the El Pollo Loco® Marks at a particular
site until it executes a Franchise Agreement for that site. Developer's use of the El Pollo Loco ® Marks shall be
limited to those rights granted under each individual Franchise Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, El Pollo
Loco® may authorize Developer in writing to use the Marks in connection with advertising and marketing activities
in connection with this Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that such usage is limited to those specific
activities or promotional materials approved by El Pollo Loco’s marketing department in advance. Developer
further agrees that its use of the Marks shall not create in its favor any right, title, or interest in or to El Pollo Loco®
Marks, but that all of such use shall inure to the benefit of El Pollo Loco, and Developer has no rights to the Marks
except to the degree specifically granted by the individual Franchise Agreement(s). Building designs and
specifications, color schemes and combinations, sign design specifications, and interior building layouts
(including equipment, equipment specification, equipment layouts, and interior color schemes and combinations)
are acknowledged by Developer to comprise part of the El Pollo Loco® System. Developer shall have no right to
license or franchise others to use the Marks by virtue of this Agreement.
6.2. Developer acknowledges that, in connection with its execution of this Agreement, it may receive
confidential and proprietary information regarding the El Pollo Loco ® System, including but not limited to the El
Pollo Loco Operational Manual. Developer recognizes the unique value and secondary meaning attached to the El
Pollo Loco® Marks and the El Pollo Loco® System, and Developer agrees that any noncompliance with the terms
of this Agreement or any unauthorized or improper use will cause irreparable damage to Franchisor and its
franchisees. Developer, therefore, agrees that if it should engage in any such unauthorized or improper use during,
or after, the term of this Agreement, Franchisor shall be entitled to both seek temporary and permanent injunctive
relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in addition to any other remedies prescribed by law.
6.3. Developer acknowledges that it will receive one (1) copy of the Operations Manual on loan from
Franchisor and that the Operations Manual shall at all times remain the sole property of the Franchisor.
7. Insurance and Indemnification.
7.1. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for
public liability, including products liability, in the amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined
single limit. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable
law.
7.2. Franchisor shall be named as an additional insured on all such insurance policies and shall be
provided with certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage. All public liability and property damage policies
shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover
under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the
negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor
with at least thirty (30) days’ notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.
7.3. Franchisor reserves the right to specify reasonable changes in the types and amounts of insurance
coverage required by this Section 7. In the event that Developer fails or refuses to obtain or maintain the required
insurance coverage from an insurance carrier acceptable to El Pollo Loco, Franchisor may, as its sole and
absolute right and without any obligations to do so, procure such coverage for Developer. In such event, Developer
shall pay the required premiums or reimburse such premiums to Franchisor upon written demand.
7.4. Developer shall defend immediately upon tender of defense, at its own cost, the Franchisor, its
subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this
section only known as “Franchisor”), from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints,
arbitrations, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees),
liens and damages (collectively for this section only known as “ Losses”), however caused, and reimburse
Franchisor for all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Franchisor in defense of any
Losses, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of, or alleged to arise out of, or in
connection with Developer’s activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee
related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting
from the employee’s training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer’s failure for
Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020any reason to fully inform any third party of Developer’s lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose.
Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from
damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not
resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further
agrees that Developer’s duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of
Developer’s duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer’s negligence, breach of
contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer’s duty to defend is regardless of the outcome
of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues
arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs
embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens or damages.
7.5. Developer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Franchisor (as defined above) from and against any
and all Losses (as defined above), however caused, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising
out of or in connection with Developer’s activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any
employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer
resulting from the employee’s training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer’s
failure for any reason to fully inform any third party of Developer’s lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any
purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from latent or other defects in the restaurant
whether or not discoverable by Franchisor, and those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising
from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or
not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Franchisor from all said Losses and shall pay for and be responsible for all
said Losses, however caused, whether by any individual, employee, third person or party, vendor, visitor, invitee,
trespasser or any firm or corporation whatsoever, whether caused by or contributed to by Franchisor, the
combined conduct of Developer and Franchisor, or active or passive negligence of Franchisor, but for the sole
negligence or willful misconduct of Franchisor.
7.6. The provisions of this Section 7 shall expire as to each El Pollo Loco ® Restaurant to be developed
under this Agreement upon execution of a Franchise Agreement for such El Pollo Loco® Restaurant. The provision
of the Franchise Agreement, in particular, Section 9 thereof (insurance and Indemnification) shall supersede this
Section 7 and govern the rights and obligations of the parties prospectively.
8. Transfer of Rights.
8.1. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Franchisor and its successors and assigns, and is fully
assignable by El Pollo Loco.
8.2. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is personal in nature with respect to
Developer, being entered into by Franchisor in reliance upon and in consideration of the personal skills,
qualifications and trust and confidence reposed in Developer and Developer's present partners, managing
members or officers if Developer is a partnership, a limited liability company or a corporation. Therefore, the
rights, privileges and interests of Developer under this Agreement shall not be assigned, sold, transferred, leased,
divided or encumbered, voluntarily or involuntarily, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the
prior written consent of El Pollo Loco, which consent may be given or withheld as El Pollo Loco’s sole and
absolute right. For purposes of this Section, a sale of stock, or any membership or partnership interest in
Developer, or a merger or other combination of Developer shall be considered a transfer of Developer's interest
prohibited hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall be permitted to assign business
organizations to serve as Franchisee after Developer individually executes the Franchise Agreements, provided
the ownership mirrors that of Developer (e.g., Developer consists of persons A (50%), B (25%) and C (25%).
Franchisee also must be owned and controlled by the same three (3) persons with each retaining the same
percentage of ownership). All other entity structures shall require the prior written approval of Franchisor.
Developer shall pay an administrative fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per transfer for each permitted transfer
to an Entity where such transfer is for the convenience of ownership only and does not involve a change of
principals of the business. Where Developer desires to add new principals to the Developer or any Franchisee
entity, Developer shall pay to Franchisor an additional Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) per new
principal to cover Franchisor’s administrative costs for reviewing the application and suitability of each new
principal as participants in the franchise business.

same, whether it is in competition with or in any other way affects the sales of Developer at the restaurants.
13. Non-Waiver.
13.1. El Pollo Loco's consent to or approval of any act or conduct of Developer requiring such consent or
approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary El Pollo Loco's consent to or approval of any
subsequent act or conduct hereunder.

20. Covenant Not to Compete.
20.1. To further protect the El Pollo Loco® System while this Agreement is in effect, Developer and each
officer, director, shareholder, member, manager, partner and other equity owner, as applicable, of Developer, if
Developer is an entity, shall neither directly nor indirectly own, operate, control or any financial interest in any other
business which would constitute a “ Competitive Business ” (as hereinafter defined) without the prior written
consent of Franchisor; provided further, that Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right, consent to the
Developer’s continued operation of any business already in existence and operating at the time of execution of
this Agreement. In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor,
Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or
assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter,
either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership,
corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which
is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory. The foregoing shall not apply to operation of an El
Pollo Loco® restaurant by Developer pursuant to a Franchise Agreement with Franchisor or the ownership by
Developer of less than five percent (5%) of the issued or outstanding stock of any company whose shares are
listed for trading on any public exchange or on the over-the-counter market, provided that Developer does not
control or become involved in the operations of any such company. For purposes of this Section 20.1, a

Mexican food products, which products individually or collectively represent more than twenty percent (20%) of the

jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall not be void, but such provision shall be limited to
the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
20.3. Developer understands and acknowledges that Franchisor shall have the right to reduce the scope of
any obligation imposed on Developer by Section 20.1, without Developer’s consent, and that such modified
provision shall be effective upon Developer’s receipt of written notice thereof.
20.4. Developer acknowledges that violation of the covenants not to compete contained in this Agreement
would result in immediate and irreparable injury to Franchisor for which no adequate remedy at law will be
available. Accordingly, Developer hereby consents to the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction
prohibiting any conduct by Developer in violation of the terms of those covenants not to compete set forth in this
Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that it may conclusively be presumed that any violation of the terms of
said covenants not to compete was accomplished by and through Developer’s unlawful utilization of Franchisor’s
