Attachment C to
Master Franchise Agreement
 
MULTI-STATE ADDENDUM
 
CALIFORNIA APPENDIX
 
 1. California Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through 20043 provide rights to you concerning termination or non-renewal
of a franchise. If the Master Franchise Agreement contains provisions that are inconsistent with the law, the law will control.
 2. The Master Franchise Agreement provides for termination upon bankruptcy. This provision may not be enforceable under Federal
Bankruptcy Law (11 U.S.C.A. Sec. 101 et seq. ).
 3. The Master Franchise Agreement contains covenants not to compete which extend beyond the termination of the agreement. These
provisions may not be enforceable under California law.
 4. Section 31125 of the California Corporation Code requires the franchisor to provide you with a disclosure document before asking you
to agree to a material modification of an existing franchise.
 5. Neither the franchisor, any person or franchise broker in Item 2 of the Disclosure Document is subject to any currently effective order
of any national securities association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A.
79a et seq., suspending or expelling such persons from membership in such association or exchange.
 6. The Master Franchise Agreement requires non-binding mediation. The mediation will occur in New York with the costs being borne
by equally by the parties. Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of
California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any
provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.
 7. The Master Franchise Agreement requires application of the laws of New York. This provision may not be enforceable under
California law.
 8. You must sign a general release if you renew or transfer your franchise. California Corporation Code 31512 voids a waiver of your
rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516). Business and Professions Code
20010 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code 20000 through 20043).
 9. THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE INVESTMENT LAW REQUIRES THAT A COPY OF ALL PROPOSED AGREEMENTS RELATING TO
THE SALE OF THE FRANCHISE BE DELIVERED TOGETHER WITH THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.
 10. The Master Franchise Agreement contains a liquidated damages clause. Under California Civil Code Section 1671, certain liquidated
damages clauses are unenforceable.

FRANCHISE AGREEMENT
 
This Franchise Agreement (this or the “Agreement”) is being entered into effective as of the _____ day of _______________, 20__ (the
“Agreement Date”). The parties to this Agreement are The Joint Corp., a Delaware corporation (“we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “The Joint Corp.“);
_________________________________________, as Franchise Owner (“you,” “Franchise Owner,” or “Franchisee”), and, if you are a
partnership, corporation, or limited liability company, your “Principal Owners” (defined below).
 
1. INTRODUCTION.
 
This Agreement has been written in an informal style in order to make it more easily readable and to be sure that you become thoroughly
familiar with all of the important rights and obligations the Agreement covers before you sign it. This Agreement includes several exhibits, all of
which are legally binding and are an integral part of the complete Franchise Agreement. In this Agreement, we refer to The Joint Corp. as “we,”
“us,” or the “Company.” We refer to you as “you,” “Franchise Owner” or “Franchisee.” If you are a corporation, partnership or limited liability
company, you will notice certain provisions that are applicable to those principal shareholders, partners or members on whose business skill,
financial capability and personal character we are relying in entering into this Agreement. Those individuals will be referred to in this Agreement as
“Principal Owners.”
 
Through the expenditure of considerable time, effort and money, we and our affiliates have devised a system for the establishment and
operation of The Joint Corp. business model, a chiropractic location that specializes in affordable, convenient, and accessible chiropractic care. It is
our mission “to improve your quality of life through affordable Chiropractic care.” Our atmosphere is fun and upbeat, and no appointments are
necessary (all of these characteristics are referred to in this Agreement as the “System”). This business model includes a location model offering all
of our franchised services and products (individually, a “Location” and collectively, the “Locations”). We identify the System by the use of certain
trademarks, service marks and other commercial symbols, including the marks “The Joint…A Chiropractic Place ®”, “The Joint…The Chiropractic
Place™” and certain associated designs, artwork and logos, which we may change or add to from time to time (the “Marks”).
 
THE JOINT…THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE™
FRANCHISE AGREEMENT
1From time to time we grant to persons who meet our qualifications, franchises to own and operate a The Joint Corp. Location franchise
business that will manage clinics that specialize in providing chiropractic services and products to the general public through licensed chiropractic
professionals (“Clinic(s)”). This Agreement is being presented to you because of the desire you have expressed to obtain the right to develop,
own, and be franchised to operate a The Joint Corp. Location (we will refer to your The Joint Corp. franchise as the “Franchise” or the “Franchised
Business”). You may purchase and operate your Franchise as a new, start-up Location (a “Start-up Location“), or may convert an existing
chiropractic practice to a The Joint Corp. Location (a “Conversion Location“). In signing this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have
conducted an independent investigation of The Joint Corp. Franchised Business, and recognize that, like any other business, the nature of it may
evolve and change over time, that an investment in a The Joint Corp. Franchised Business involves business risks, and that the success of this
business venture is primarily dependent on  your business abilities and efforts.
 
We expressly disclaim making, and you acknowledge that you have not received or relied on, any guarantee, express or implied, as to the
revenues, profits, or likelihood of success of The Joint Corp. Franchise venture contemplated by this Agreement. You acknowledge that there have
been no representations by us or our affiliates or our or their respective officers, directors, members, employees, or agents that are inconsistent
with the statements made in our current Franchise Disclosure Document concerning the Franchised Business, or the provisions of this Agreement.
You further represent to us, as an inducement to our entering into this Agreement with you, that there have been no misrepresentations to us in
your application for the rights granted by this Agreement, or in the financial information provided by you and your Principal Owners.
 
2. GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
 
2.1 Term; Reference to Exhibit 1.
 
You have applied for a franchise to own and operate a The Joint Corp. Location, and we have approved your application in reliance on all
of the representations you made in that application. As a result, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, we grant to you a Franchise to
operate a The Joint Corp. Location offering all products, services, and proprietary programs of ours, in accordance with all elements of the System,
that we may require for The Joint Corp. Locations.
 
You must operate the Franchise at a mutually agreeable site (the “Premises”) to be identified after the signing of this Agreement, and to
use the System and the Marks in the operation of that Franchise, for a term of 10 years (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term will begin on the
Agreement Date. (For convenience, the expiration date of the Initial Term is listed on  Exhibit 1.) Termination or expiration of this Agreement will
constitute a termination or expiration of your Franchise. (All references to the “term” of this Agreement refer to the period from the Agreement Date
to the date on which this Agreement actually terminates or expires.)
 
THE JOINT…THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE™
FRANCHISE AGREEMENT
22.2 Full Term Performance.
 
You specifically agree to be obligated to operate the Franchise, perform the obligations of this Agreement, and continuously exert your
best efforts to promote and enhance the business of the Franchise for the full term of this Agreement.
 
2.3 Management Agreement with Professional Corporation – Non-Licensed Franchisees.
 
If you are not a licensed chiropractor, prior to commencing operations of the Franchised Business, you must enter into a management
agreement (“Management Agreement”) with a chiropractic professional corporation (or a professional limited liability company, if permitted in the
state in which the Clinic is located) (a “PC”) whereby you will provide to the PC management and administrative services and support consistent
with the System and as outlined in our form of Management Agreement, a copy of which is included as an Exhibit to our Disclosure Document, to
support the PC's chiropractic practice and its delivery of chiropractic services and related products to chiropractic patients, consistent with all
applicable laws and regulations.
 
The PC shall employ and control the chiropractors and other chiropractic personnel that will provide the actual chiropractic services
required to be delivered at and through the Clinic.  You shall not provide any actual chiropractic services, nor shall you supervise, direct, control or
suggest to, the PC or its chiropractors or employees the manner in which the PC provides or may provide chiropractic services to its patients. You
acknowledge and agree that we will not provide any chiropractic services, nor will we supervise, direct, control or suggest to, the PC or its
chiropractors or employees the manner in which the PC provide chiropractic services to its patients.
 
Due to various federal and state laws regarding the practice of chiropractic medicine, and the ownership and operation of chiropractic
practices and health care businesses that provide chiropractic services, you understand and acknowledge that that you, as non-chiropractor
Location franchisee, shall not engage in any practices that are, or may appear to be, the practice of chiropractic medicine. You acknowledge that the
PC must offer all chiropractic services in accordance with the Management Agreement and the System.
 
You must use our standard form of Management Agreement, however, you may negotiate the monetary terms and, with our written
consent, certain other terms of the relationship with the PC. We will not unreasonably withhold our approval to requested changes in the
Management Agreement. You must obtain our written approval of the final Management Agreement prior to your execution. We must approve the
PC candidate. You shall ensure that the PC offers all chiropractic services in accordance with the Management Agreement and the System. If you
are not able to find a suitable chiropractor to create, own and staff the PC, we will attempt to help you find a suitable PC. You must have a
Management Agreement in effect with a PC at all times during the operation of the Franchised Business and during the Initial Term of this
Agreement.

FRANCHISE AGREEMENT
3If you are a licensed chiropractor, or part of a PC owned by licensed chiropractors, you do not need to execute a Management Agreement.
However, you are still responsible for compliance with all laws application to the operation of a chiropractic Clinic and your Location franchise.
 
2.4 Waiver of Management Agreement.
 
In certain states, it may be permissible under the existing laws that may be applicable to chiropractic professionals and/or practices, such
as chiropractic clinics, for a non-chiropractor to both own and operate a Clinic and a Location Franchise, including hiring chiropractic and other
professional personnel and providing chiropractic services to patients at the Clinic. If you determine that the laws that would apply to a Clinic in
your state would permit you to do so, you may request that we waive certain of the requirements of the Franchise Agreement related to separating
the operation of the chiropractic aspects of the Clinic from the management aspects. In particular, you (i) would not enter into a Management
Agreement with a PC that, as a separate entity, would otherwise operate the Clinic and provide all chiropractic services, and (ii) you would not be
restricted from hiring and supervising chiropractic professionals. Any waiver, or any modification of our standards, would be subject to compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations. If we agree to do a waiver, you must enter into an Amendment to Waive Management Agreement (“Waiver
Agreement”), a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to our Disclosure Document. Under the Waiver Agreement, you will agree that, instead of
entering into the Management Agreement with a separate PC, you will (a) operate the Clinic, including performing all responsibilities and
obligations of the “PC” under the Management Agreement, and (b) manage the Clinic as required in this Agreement and by performing all the
responsibilities and obligations of the “Company” under the Management Agreement.
 
You are responsible for operating in full compliance with all laws that apply to a Clinic, and you must make your own determination as to
your legal compliance obligations. Additionally, the laws applicable to your Clinic may change, and if there are any chiropractic regulations or other
laws that would render your operation of the Clinic through a single entity (or otherwise) in violation of any medical regulations, you must
immediately advise us of such change and of the your proposed corrective action to comply with chiropractic regulations, including (if applicable)
entering into a Management Agreement with a PC. Similarly, if we discover any such laws, upon providing you notice of such laws, you agree to
make such changes as are necessary to comply with medical regulations, including (if applicable) entering into a Management Agreement with a
PC.

42.5 Selection of Premises; No Protected Territory; Reservation of Rights .
 
You and we will mutually select the location of the Premises upon or after the signing of this Agreement. You acknowledge that the
Franchise granted by this Agreement gives you the right to operate your Franchise only at the Premises. Although we will not seek to operate or
grant others the right to operate a The Joint Corp. Location within the same general area as the Premises, we make no guarantee of any protected
territory. Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 2.5, we retain all rights with respect to The Joint Corp. Location franchises, the Marks and

revenues” includes the gross revenues of any P.C. or any of P.C.’s clinics that are managed by you pursuant to a Management Agreement, even if

those revenues were recognized on your books. You and we acknowledge and agree that the Royalty Fee represents compensation paid by you to

described in Exhibit 4. No Interests in Franchise Owner will, during the term of this Agreement, be “public” securities (i.e., securities that require, for
their issuance, registration with any state or federal authority). (An “Interest” is defined to mean any shares, membership interests, or partnership

You understand and acknowledge that the rights and duties created by this Agreement are personal to you and that we have entered into
this Agreement in reliance on the individual or collective character, skill, aptitude, attitude, business ability, and financial capacity of you and your
Principal Owners. Accordingly, neither this Agreement nor any part of your interest in it, nor any Interest (as defined in Paragraph 14.2) of
Franchise Owner or a Principal Owner, may be transferred (see definition below) without our advance written approval if such transfer will result in
the Principal Owner(s) set forth in  Exhibit 4 holding less than a seventy-five percent (75%) Interest in Franchise Owner. Any Transfer that is made
without our approval will constitute a breach of this Agreement and convey no rights to or interests in this Agreement, you, the Franchise, or any
other The Joint Corp. franchise.
 
As used in this Agreement the term “Transfer” means any voluntary, involuntary, direct or indirect assignment, sale, gift, exchange, grant
of a security interest, or occurrence of any other event which would or might change the ownership of any Interest, and includes, without
limitation: (1) the Transfer of ownership of capital stock, partnership interest or other ownership interest (including the granting of options (such as
stock options or any option which give anyone ownership rights now or in the future); (2) merger or consolidation, or issuance of additional
securities representing an ownership interest in Franchise Owner; (3) sale of common stock of Franchise Owner sold pursuant to a private
placement or registered public offering; (4) Transfer of an Interest in a divorce proceeding or otherwise by operation of law; or (5) Transfer of an
Interest by will, declaration of or transfer in trust, or under the laws of intestate succession.
 
We will not unreasonably withhold consent to a Transfer of an Interest by a Principal Owner to a member of his or her immediate family or
to your key employees, so long as all Principal Owners together retain a “controlling Interest” (i.e., the minimum ownership percentage listed in
Exhibit 4), although we reserve the right to impose reasonable conditions on the Transfer as a requirement for our consent.
 
Interests owned by persons other than the Principal Owners (“minority owners”) may be Transferred without our advance consent unless
the Transfer would give that transferee and any person or group of persons affiliated or having a common interest with the transferee more than a
collective twenty-five percent (25%) Interest in Franchise Owner, in which case our advance written approval for the Transfer must be obtained.
Your formal partnership, corporation or other formation documents and all stock certificates, partnership units or other evidence of ownership must
recite or bear a legend reflecting the transfer restrictions of this Paragraph 14.4.

3714.6 Right of First Refusal.
 
If you or any of your Principal Owners wishes to Transfer any Interest, we will have a right of first refusal to purchase that Interest as
follows. The party proposing the Transfer (the “transferor”) must obtain a bona fide, executed written offer (accompanied by a “good faith” earnest
money deposit of at least five percent (5%) of the proposed purchase price) from a responsible and fully disclosed purchaser, and must submit an
exact copy of the offer to us. You also agree to provide us with any other information we need to evaluate the offer, if we request it within five (5)
days of receipt of the offer. We have the right, exercisable by delivering written notice to the transferor within fifteen (15) days from the date of last
delivery to us of the offer and any other documents we have requested, to purchase the Interest for the price and on the terms and conditions
contained in the offer, except that we may substitute cash for any form of payment proposed in the offer, and will not be obligated to pay any
“finder’s” or broker’s fees that are a part of the proposed Transfer. We also will not be required to pay any amount for any claimed value of
intangible benefits, for example, possible tax benefits that may result by structuring and/or closing the proposed Transfer in a particular manner or
for any consideration payable other than the bona fide purchase price for the Interest proposed to be transferred. (In fact, we may in our sole and
absolute discretion withhold consent to any proposed Transfer if the offer directly or indirectly requires payment of any consideration other than
the bona fide purchase price for the Interest proposed to be transferred.) Our credit will be deemed equal to the credit of any other proposed
purchaser, and we will have at least sixty (60) days to prepare for closing. We will be entitled to all customary representations and warranties given
purchasers in connection with such sales. If the proposed Transfer includes assets not related to the operation of the Franchise, we may purchase
only the assets related to the operation of the Franchise or may also purchase the other assets. (An equitable purchase price will be allocated to
each asset included in the Transfer.)

terms of the offer, as long as we have approved the Transfer as provided in this Section 14. You must immediately notify us of any changes in the
terms of an offer. Any material change in the terms of an offer before closing will make it a new offer, revoking any previous approval or previously
made election to purchase and giving us a new right of first refusal effective as of the day we receive formal notice of a material change in the terms.
If the sale to the Proposed New Owner is not completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after we have approved the Transfer, our approval of
the proposed Transfer will expire. Any later proposal to complete that proposed Transfer will be deemed a new offer, giving us a new right of
approval and right of first refusal effective as of the day we receive formal notice of the new (or continuing) proposal. We will not exercise a right of
first refusal with respect to a proposed Transfer of less than a controlling interest to a member of a Principal Owner’s immediate family or to your
key employees.

If you continue to operate the Franchise after termination of this Agreement, in addition to any other right or remedy we may have

because it is a reasonable estimation of the damages that would occur from such a breach, and it will almost certainly be impossible to calculate
precisely the actual damages from such a breach.

Franchise Agreement
THIS FRANCHISE AGREEMENT (the “Agreement ”) is made and entered into as of the “ Effective Date ” that we
have indicated on the signature page of this Agreement by and between:
● Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal place of business at
1500 Solana Blvd., Suite 450, Westlake, Texas 76262 (“ we,” “us,” or “our”); and
● a [resident of] [corporation organized in] [limited liability company organized in] the state of and having offices at
(“you” or the “ Franchisee ”).
Introduction
We have developed our own distinctive and proprietary systems for insurance services, including home insurance,
automobile insurance, life insurance, specialty lines, and business insurance (the “ System”). Our System includes
(among other things): business processes, technologies, trade secrets, customer lists, knowledge, know-how, trade
names, service marks, trademarks, logos, emblems, trade dress and other intellectual property; distinctive signage;
standards, specifications and sources for services, products, supplies, appearance, operations and management
control; safety standards; training and assistance; purchasing programs; and advertising, marketing, promotional
and sales programs; all of which we may periodically change, discontinue, improve, modify and further develop.
We identify the System by means of our Proprietary Marks. Our proprietary marks include certain trade names (for
example, the mark “Goosehead Insurance” and logo), service marks, trademarks, logos, emblems, and indicia of
origin, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks that we may periodically specify in writing for
use in connection with the System (all of these are referred to as our “ Proprietary Marks”). We continue to develop,
use, and control the use of our Proprietary Marks in order to identify for the public the source of services and
products marketed under those marks and under the System, and to represent the System’s high standards of
quality, appearance, and service.
We are in the business of developing and awarding franchise rights to third party franchisees, such as you, to
develop and operate businesses providing insurance services (“ Services”) to clients under the System and using the
Proprietary Marks (“ Goosehead Businesses”).
You have asked to enter into the business of operating a Goosehead Business under our System and wish to obtain
a franchise from us for that purpose, as well as to receive the training and other assistance we provide as described
in this Agreement. You also understand and acknowledge the importance of our high standards of quality,
appearance, and service and the necessity of operating the business franchised under this Agreement in conformity
with our standards and specifications.
You will be in the business of operating a Goosehead Business, using the same brand and Proprietary Marks as
other independent businesses that operate other Goosehead Businesses under the System. We will not operate
your Goosehead Business for you, although we have (and will continue) to set standards for Goosehead Businesses
that you will have chosen to adopt as yours by signing this Agreement and by your day-to-day management of your
Goosehead Business to our brand standards.
Page 1 of 80In recognition of all of the details noted above, the parties have chosen to enter into this Agreement, taking into
account all of the promises and commitments that they are each making to one another in this contract, and for other
good and valuable consideration (the sufficiency and receipt of which they hereby acknowledge) and they agree as
follows:
1 GRANT
1.1 Rights and Obligations . We grant you the right, and you accept the obligation, all under the terms (and
subject to the conditions) of this Agreement:
1.1.1 To operate one Goosehead Business under the System (the “ Franchised Business ”);
1.1.2 To use the Proprietary Marks and the System, but only in connection with the Franchised Business
(recognizing that we may periodically change or improve the Proprietary Marks and the System); and
1.1.3 To do all of those things only at the Approved Location (as defined in Section 1.2 below).
1.2 Approved Location . The street address of the location for the Franchised Business approved under this
Agreement is specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement, and is referred to as the “ Approved Location .”
1.2.1 When this Agreement is signed, if you have not yet obtained (and we have not yet approved in
writing) a location for the Franchised Business, then you agree to enter into the site selection
addendum (the “ Site Selection Addendum ,” attached as Exhibit G to this Agreement) at the same
time as you sign this Agreement. You will then find a site which will become the Approved Location
after we have given you our written approval for that site and you have obtained the right to occupy
the premises, by lease, sublease, or acquisition of the property, all subject to our prior written
approval and in accordance with the Site Selection Addendum.
1.2.2 We have the right to grant or withhold approval of the Approved Location under this Section 1.2. You
understand, acknowledge, and agree that our review and approval of your proposed location, under
this Section 1.2 or pursuant to the Site Selection Addendum, does not constitute our assurance,
representation, or warranty of any kind that your Franchised Business at the Approved Location will
be profitable or successful (as further described in Section 5 of the Site Selection Addendum).
1.2.3 You agree not to relocate the Franchised Business without our prior written consent. Any proposed
relocation will be subject to our review of the proposed new site under our then-current standards for
site selection, and we will also have the right to take into consideration any commitments we have
given to other franchisees, licensees, landlords, and other parties relating to the proximity of a new
Goosehead Business to their establishment. You must pay us a fee in the amount of Five Hundred
Dollars ($500) at the time you request the relocation of the Franchised Business.
1.3 No Protected Territory . You expressly acknowledge and agree that this franchise is non-exclusive, and that
this Agreement does not grant or imply any protected area or territory for the Franchised Business.
Accordingly, we retain the right to conduct any business and sell
Page 2 of 80services and products at any location, notwithstanding the proximity of that business activity to the Approved
Location. We retain all rights, including but not limited to: (a) the right to use, and to license others to use, the
System and the Proprietary Marks for the operation of Goosehead Businesses at any location; (b) the right to
sell, and to license others to sell, products and services (including Services) that are also authorized for sale
at Goosehead Businesses through other channels of distribution (including, but not limited to, through
catalogs, mail order, toll free numbers, sales via Internet websites, and other forms of electronic commerce);
(c) the right to acquire and operate businesses of any kind and to grant or franchise the right to others to
operate other businesses of any kind, no matter where located; and (d) the right to use and license the use of
the Proprietary Marks and other marks in connection with the operation of businesses at any location, which
businesses and marks may be the same as, similar to, or different from the Franchised Business and the
Proprietary Marks, on such terms and conditions as we deem advisable, and without granting you any rights
therein.
1.4 Limits on Where You May Operate .
1.4.1 You may offer and sell Services only: (a) in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and
the procedures set out in the Manual (defined below); and (b) to customers of the Franchised
Business.
1.4.2 You agree not to offer or sell any services or products (including the Services and Products) through
any means other than through the Franchised Business as provided in this Section 1.4; and
therefore, for example, you agree not to offer or sell services or products from satellite locations,
temporary locations, mobile vehicles or formats, carts or kiosks. Unless you become licensed in
another state and receive prior written approval from us to offer insurance policies in that state, you
may only provide and deliver Services to customers located within the State in which the Approved
Location is situated.
2 TERM AND RENEWAL
2.1 Term. The term of this Agreement starts on the Effective Date and, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
in accordance with its provisions, will expire ten (10) years from the Effective Date.
2.2 Renewal. You will have the right to renew your rights to operate the Franchise Business for two (2) additional
successor terms of five (5) years, so long as you have satisfied all of the conditions specified in Sections 2.2.1
through 2.2.10 before each such renewal:
2.2.1 You agree to give us written notice of your choice to renew at least six (6) months before the end of
the term of this Agreement (but not more than nine (9) months before the term expires).
2.2.2 You agree to remodel and refurbish the Franchised Business to comply with our then-current
standards in effect for new Goosehead Businesses (as well as the provisions of Sections 8.9 and
8.10 below).
2.2.3 At the time of renewal, you must be in material compliance with the provisions of this Agreement
(including any amendment to this Agreement), any successor to this Agreement, and/or any other
contract between you (and your affiliates) and us (and our affiliates), and in our reasonable
judgment, you must have been in material compliance during the term of this Agreement, even if we
did not issue a notice of
Page 3 of 80default or exercise our right to terminate this Agreement if you did not meet your obligations.
2.2.4 You must have timely met all of your financial obligations to us, our affiliates, the Brand Fund, and/or
the Regional Fund, as well as your vendors, throughout the term of this Agreement (even if we did
not issue a notice of default or exercise our right to terminate this Agreement if you did not meet
your obligations).
2.2.5 You must sign our then-current  form of franchise agreement, which will supersede this Agreement in
all respects (except with respect to the renewal provisions of the new franchise agreement, which will
not supersede this Section 2), and which you acknowledge and agree may contain terms, conditions,
obligations, rights, and other provisions that are substantially and materially different from those
spelled out in this Agreement (including, for example, a higher percentage royalty fee and marketing
contribution). If you are an entity, then your direct and indirect owners must also sign and deliver to
us a personal guarantee of your obligations under the renewal form of franchise agreement. (In this
Agreement, the term “ entity” includes a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, and a
limited liability partnership.)
2.2.6 You agree to sign and deliver to us a release, in a form that we will provide (which will be a mutual
release with limited exclusions), which will release all claims against us and our affiliates, and our
respective officers, directors, members, managers, agents, and employees. If you are an entity, then
your affiliates and your direct and indirect owners (and any other parties that we reasonably
request) must also sign and deliver that release to us.
2.2.7 You and your personnel must meet our then-current  qualification and training requirements.
2.2.8 You agree to present to us satisfactory evidence that you have the right to remain in possession of
the Approved Location for the duration of the renewal term of this Agreement.

all other parties with whom you do business.

3.2 Layout and Equipping of a Goosehead Business . We have the right to provide our standards and
specifications for the layout and design of a Goosehead Business, including specifications for the exterior and

the layout and specifications as we deem appropriate. We will also provide the site selection and lease review

assistance that we think is advisable, and as may be described in the Manual.

below) have successfully completed training and you have received our prior written approval.
3.8 Periodic Assistance. We will provide you periodic assistance in the marketing, management, and operation of
the Franchised Business at the times and in the manner that we determine. We may periodically offer you the
services of certain of our representatives, such as a representative from agency support, and these
representatives may periodically visit your Franchised Business and offer advice regarding your operations.
3.9 Revenue Report . On the 25 th day of each month, we will provide you with a detailed report of Commissions
(as defined below) and Agency Fees (as defined below) received on your behalf for insurance policies written
in the preceding calendar months. In order to provide you with this report, we must receive a commission
detail report from the carrier by the 20 th day of the month, for policies you wrote during the preceding month.
The report will only include Commissions and Agency Fees related to policies properly recorded in our agency
management system as prescribed in the Manual.
3.10 Call Center. We will maintain a call center, staffed by licensed insurance agents, for the purpose of providing
centralized customer service for all businesses operating under the System and the Proprietary Marks. The
call center’s hours will be at least between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday (excluding
holidays). You must comply with any rules and regulations adopted by us (in the Manual or otherwise)
regarding the call center.
3.11 Services Performed . You acknowledge and agree that any of our designees, employees, agents, or
independent contractors (such as an “area developer”) may perform any duty or obligation imposed on us by
the Agreement, as we may direct (if so, we will, nonetheless, remain responsible to you for the performance of
these obligations).
3.12 Our Decision-Making . In fulfilling our obligations under this Agreement, and in conducting any activities or
exercising our rights pursuant to this Agreement, we (and our affiliates) will always have the right: (a) to take
into account, as we see fit, the effect on, and the interests of, other franchised and company-owned or

(d) to introduce new proprietary items and non-proprietary  items; and/or (e) to allocate resources and new
developments between and among systems, and/or our affiliates, as we see fit. You understand and agree
that all of our obligations under this Agreement are subject to this Section, and that nothing in this Section will
in any way affect your obligations under this Agreement.

Agreement, we may ask that you execute and deliver to us a confirmation (the “ Confirmation of
Performance ”), in a form we reasonably request, confirming that we have performed those obligations. If we
ask you to provide us with such a certificate, you agree to execute and deliver the Confirmation of
Performance to us within three (3) business days after our request. However, if you do not reasonably believe
that we have performed all of our pre-opening  obligations, you must, within that same three (3) day period,
provide us with written notice specifically describing the obligations that we have not performed. Not later than
three (3) business days after we complete all the obligations that you specified in that notice, you agree to
execute and deliver the Confirmation of Performance to us. You agree to do so even if we performed such
obligations after the time performance was due under this Agreement. The term “pre-opening  obligations”
means the obligations we have to you under this Agreement that must be performed before the date when
your Franchised Business starts its operations.
4 FEES; SALES REPORTING
4.1 Initial Franchise Fee . You agree to pay us an initial franchise fee in the amount set out in the Declarations
Page attached as Exhibit A (the “ Initial Franchise Fee ”). The Initial Franchise Fee is not refundable in

appointments, and pre-opening  assistance as part of the initial launch of the Franchised Business. At your
election, the Initial Franchise Fee is due and payable to us in one of the following ways:
4.1.1 You may pay to us the Initial Franchise Fee, in full, on the day that you sign this Agreement; or
4.1.2 You may elect to pay to us a portion of the Initial Franchise Fee on the day that you sign this
Agreement in the amount set out in the Declarations Page attached as Exhibit A, and to pay to us
the remaining portion of the Initial Franchise Fee, with interest, pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the promissory note attached to this Agreement as Exhibit I (the “ Promissory Note ”). You
acknowledge and agree that any default under the terms of the Promissory Note, including a failure
to make any payments to us under the Promissory Note, shall be a default under this Agreement.
4.2 Royalty Fee . We will receive all Commissions (defined below) from insurance carriers. We will receive all
Premiums (defined below), Policy Fees (defined below) and Agency Fees on your behalf. If the event that any
Premiums, Policy Fees, or Agency Fees are received directly by you, these funds must be forwarded to us
within twenty four (24) hours of receipt. We will retain Agency Fees and will forward Premiums and Policy Fees
to the insurance carriers. Beginning on the date you begin operations under this Agreement, which is agreed
to be the date set out in the Declarations Page (the “ Commencement Date ”), we will remit to you Net
Revenues on a monthly basis. As used in this Agreement:
4.2.1 the term “Agency Fees ” will mean fees that are charged by you for issuing a new policy pursuant to
the Manual.
4.2.2 the term “ Commission” will mean the total fees paid in cash to us, by insurance carriers as a
percentage of the Premiums generated by insurance policies sold by the Franchised Business, on
all new and renewal policies.
4.2.3 the term “ Gross Revenues ” means the amount of Commissions and Agency Fees received in
cash, net of reversals of Commissions for policy cancellations or policy
Page 6 of 80changes and net of Agency Fee refunds, for insurance services provided by the Franchised
Business; Gross Revenues will not include any Premiums or Policy Fees collected by the Franchised
Business on behalf of any insurance carrier.
4.2.4 The term “ Minimum Royalty ” means a minimum monthly Royalty Fee payment, beginning six (6)
months after the Commencement Date, in the following amounts:
Number of Months following the
Commencement Date
Amount of Monthly Minimum Royalty
Six (6) to Eighteen (18) Six Hundred Dollars ($600)
Nineteen (19) and for the remainder of
the term of this Agreement
One Thousand Dollars ($1,000)
4.2.5 the term “Month ” means a calendar month or such other four (4) to five (5) week period that we may
designate (provided that there will not be more than 13 “Months” during any year); and
4.2.6 the term “ Net Revenues ” means Gross Revenues net of all amounts due to us under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Royalty Fees, Marketing Contributions (if applicable),
Technology Fees, and payments due to us under the Promissory Note (if applicable).
4.2.7 the term “Premiums” will mean fees that are paid to the insurance carrier for insurance coverage.
4.2.8 the term “Policy Fees ” will mean fees to be paid to the insurance carrier for the issuance of a policy.
4.2.9 the term “ Royalty Fee ” is charged in consideration of you and your Managers’ and Producers’ use
of our business processes, ongoing carrier relationships, trade secrets, know-how, trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos, emblems, trade dress, intellectual property, and back office
support functions. The Royalty Fee will be the following amounts: (a) the greater of (i) twenty percent
(20%) of Gross Revenues on insurance policies in their initial term, or (ii) the Minimum Royalty
(defined below); and (b) fifty percent (50%) of Gross Revenues on policies in their renewal terms
and policies written for existing customers on the same risk profile within a one-year period of the
cancellation of their existing policy (also known as “ re-writes ”).
4.2.10 The “ Technology Fee ” will be an amount necessary to reimburse us for our costs of providing
Required Software (defined in Section 14 below) to you. The Technology Fee may vary during the
term of this Agreement, and we have the right to adjust the amount of the Technology Fee to
account for our increased or decreased costs, separate from the Index.
4.3 Monthly Accounting . Once a Month, the insurance carriers will send a commission report and Commissions
earned by you, to us. On the 25 th day of each Month, unless this Agreement has been terminated for any
reason, we will pay to you the Net Revenues for all policies identified in a commission detail report that we
receive from the insurance carrier. Please
Page 7 of 80note that we expect each insurance carrier to submit commission detail reports on a Monthly basis for all
policies written during the preceding Month by no later than the 20 th day of the subsequent Month. But, if a
carrier does not provide us with a commission detail report (and the applicable Commission) by the 20 th day
of the Month, or if a policy is not identified in the commission detail report we receive, you will not receive the
Gross Revenues for those policies until the insurance carrier provides us with the appropriate report and/or
Commissions. We may delay or withhold payment of Net Revenues — on a policy by policy basis — for any
policy for which you fail to observe the risk management procedures we prescribe in the Manual, including
that you obtain a signed application from the customer and provide all required documentation. If we review
your accounting and client records (as described in Section 12 below) and find that you have not forwarded to
us any Premiums, Policy Fees and/or Agency Fees that you collect, we may pay the appropriate Premiums
and Policy Fees to the insurance carrier. You will be responsible for reimbursing us for those amounts and the
applicable Agency Fees, in addition to paying a fee to us to cover our reasonable expenses in processing
those payments and interest on those amounts, at the rate of two percent (2%) per Month, or if less, the
maximum rate permitted by law. Entitlement to such interest will be in addition to any other remedies we may
have.
4.3.1 You agree to deliver to us all of the reports, statements, and/or other information that is required
under Section 12 below, at the time and in the format that we reasonably request.
4.3.2 You agree to establish an arrangement for electronic funds transfer to us, or electronic deposit to us
of any payments required under this Agreement. Among other things, to implement this point, you
agree to sign and return to us our current form of “ACH—Authorization Agreement for Prearranged
Payments (Direct Debits),” a copy of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D (and any
replacements for that form that we deem to be periodically needed to implement this Section 4.3.2),
and you agree to; (a) comply with the payment and reporting procedures that we may specify in the
Manual or otherwise in writing; and (b) maintain an adequate balance in your bank account at all
times to pay by electronic means the charges that you owe under this Agreement. If we elect to use
ACH withdrawal to sweep payment of fees, then you will not be required to submit a separate
payment to us unless you do not maintain sufficient funds to pay the full amount due.
4.3.3 You acknowledge and agree that your obligations to make full and timely payment of Royalty Fees
and Marketing Contributions (and all other sums due to us) are absolute, unconditional, fully-earned
(by us), and due when you are open and in operation.
4.3.4 You agree that you will not, for any reason, delay or withhold the payment of any amount due to us
under this Agreement; put into escrow any payment due to us; set-off payments due to us against
any claims or alleged claims that you may allege against us, the Brand Fund, a Regional Fund,
affiliates, suppliers, or others. We reserve the right to apply any monies received from you to any of
your obligations as we determine and to withhold payment of any monies if this Agreement has been
terminated for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to set-off as part of
Net Revenues any amounts you owe to us.
4.3.5 You agree that if you do not provide us, as requested, with access to your computer system to
obtain sales information or, if we require pursuant to Section 12.1.4 below or otherwise, printed and
signed sales reports, then we will have the right to impute your sales for any period using (among
other things) your sales figures from any
Page 8 of 80Month(s) that we choose (which may be those with your highest grossing sales), and that you agree
to pay the royalties on that amount (whether by check or by our deduction of that amount from your
direct debit account).
4.3.6 You agree that you will not, whether on grounds of alleged non-performance  by us or others,
withhold payment of any fee, including, without limitation, Royalty Fees or Marketing Contributions,
nor withhold or delay submission of any reports due under this Agreement.
4.4 No Subordination . You agree: (a) not to subordinate to any other obligation your obligation to pay us the
Royalty Fee and/or any other amount payable to us, whether under this Agreement or otherwise; and (b) that
any such subordination commitment that you may give without our prior written consent will be null and void.
4.5 Late Payment. If we do not (or an applicable marketing fund does not) receive any payment due under this
Agreement on or before the due date, then that amount will be deemed overdue. If any payment is overdue,
then you agree to pay us, in addition to the overdue amount, interest on the overdue amount from the date it
was due until paid, at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum (but not more than the maximum rate
permitted by law, if any such maximum rate applies). Our entitlement to such interest will be in addition to any
other remedies we may have. Any report that we do not receive on or before the due date will also be deemed
overdue.
4.6 Other Funds Due . You agree to pay us, within ten (10) days of our written request (which is accompanied by
reasonable substantiating material), any amounts that we have paid, that we have become obligated to pay,
and/or that we choose to pay on your behalf.
4.7 Index. We have the right to adjust, for inflation, all fixed-dollar amounts under this Agreement (except for the
Initial Franchise Fee) once a year to reflect changes in the Index from the year in which you signed this

7.1 Products. You agree to buy all products, equipment, furniture, supplies, materials and other products used or
offered for sale at the Franchised Business only from suppliers as to whom we have given you our prior
written approval (and whom we have not subsequently disapproved). In this regard, the parties further agree:

any such supplier unless and until we have given you our prior written consent to do so. We have
the right to require that our representatives be permitted to inspect the supplier’s facilities, and that
samples from the supplier be delivered to us. You (or the supplier) may be required to pay a charge,
not to exceed the reasonable cost of the inspection, as well as the actual cost of the test. We have
the right to also require that the supplier comply with such other requirements that we have the right
to designate, including payment of reasonable continuing inspection fees and administrative costs
and/or other payment to us by the supplier on account of their dealings with you or other
franchisees, for use of our trademarks, and for services that we may render to such suppliers. We
also reserve the right, at our option, to periodically re-inspect the facilities and products of any such
approved supplier and to revoke our approval if the supplier does not continue to meet any of our

our standards, specifications, or formulas to prospective suppliers, which we have the right to deem
confidential.

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement. In this event, we may limit the number of
approved suppliers with whom you may deal, designate sources that you must use for some or all
Products and other products and services, and/or refuse any of your requests if we believe that this
action is in the best interests of the System or the network of Goosehead Businesses. We have the
right to approve or disapprove of the suppliers who may be permitted to sell products to you. Any of
our affiliates that sell products to you will do so at our direction. If you are in default of this
Agreement, we reserve the right to direct our affiliates not to sell products to you, or to withhold
certain discounts which might otherwise be available to you.

purchases of Products, other products, paper goods, ink, and other items (such as packaging). You

identify and implement quantitative operational performance standards (for example, the number of insurance
policies written in a specific line of business or in the aggregate) upon which your development and active
implementation of the System will be evaluated. If your performance under such standards fails to meet or
exceed the performance of the lowest twenty-five percent (25%) of all franchised Goosehead Businesses
operating under the System, as we determine, in any one (1) fiscal quarter of any fiscal year, we may elect to:
(a) require you and such other of your employees, as we determine, to attend and complete to our
satisfaction such additional training programs that we deem necessary; or (b) provide such on-site assistance
and consultation as we deem necessary. In the event we provide any such additional training, assistance or
consultation, you will be responsible for all costs and expenses for that training assistance or consultation,
which may include a fee payable to us. If you fail to improve your performance under such standards by at
least ten percent (10%), and fail to meet or exceed the performance of the lowest twenty-five percent (25%) of
all franchised Goosehead Businesses operating under the System in each subsequent fiscal quarter we may,
in our discretion, place your agency in default status, which may result in termination pursuant to Section 17.3
below.
8.16 Franchisee Advisory Council.  We may establish an organization to facilitate communication between us and
franchisees operating under the Proprietary Marks and the System (the “ Franchisee Advisory Council ”). In
the event that we form the Franchisee Advisory Council, you agree to fully participate in the Franchisee
Advisory Council if requested by us. The Franchisee Advisory Council may be terminated or dissolved by us
at any time.

Page 25 of 8012.2 Financial Statements.
12.2.1 You agree to provide us, at your expense, and in a format that we reasonably specify, a complete set
of annual financial statements prepared on a review basis by an independent certified public
accountant (as to whom we do not have a reasonable objection) within ninety (90) days after the end

addition to, and not in lieu of, the electronic reporting required under Section 14 below.
12.4 Our Right to Inspect Your Books and Records . We have the right at all reasonable times to examine, copy,
and/or personally review or audit (at our expense) all of your sales receipts, books, records, and sales and
income tax returns in person or through electronic access (at our option). We will also have the right, at any
time, to have an independent audit made of your books and records. If an inspection should reveal that you
have understated any payments in any report to us, then this will constitute a default under this Agreement,
and you agree to immediately pay us the amount understated upon demand, in addition to interest from the
date such amount was due until paid, at the rate of one and one-half
Page 26 of 80percent (1.5%) per month (but not more than the maximum rate permitted by law, if any such maximum rate
applies). If we conduct an inspection because you did not timely provide sales reports to us, or if an
inspection discloses that you understated your sales, in any report to us (and/or underpaid your royalties), by
three percent (3%) or more, or if you did not maintain and/or provide us with access to your records, then you
agree (in addition to paying us the overdue amount and interest) to reimburse us for any and all costs and
expenses we incur in connection with the inspection (including travel, lodging and wages expenses, and
reasonable accounting and legal costs). These remedies will be in addition to any other remedies we may
have. We may exercise our rights under this Section 12 directly or by engaging outside professional advisors
(for example, a CPA) to represent us.
12.5 Operational Inspections . In addition to the provisions of Section 12.5 above, you also grant to us and our
agents the right to enter upon the Franchised Business premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of
conducting inspections, for among other purposes, preserving the validity of the Proprietary Marks, and
verifying your compliance with this Agreement and the policies and procedures outlined in the Manual. You
agree to cooperate with our representatives in such inspections by rendering such assistance as they may
reasonably request; and, upon notice from us or from our agents (and without limiting our other rights under
this Agreement), you agree to take such steps as may be necessary to correct immediately any deficiencies
detected during any such inspection. You further agree to pay us our then-current per diem fee for our
representative(s) and to reimburse us for our reasonable travel expenses if additional inspections at the
Franchised Business are required when a violation has occurred and you have not corrected the violation, or
if you did not provide us with your records or access to your records upon reasonable request that is
permitted under this Agreement.
13 MARKETING

amount up to two percent (2%) of Gross Revenues to be allocated in the manner described in Section 13.2

and at the times required under Section 4.3 above (and as otherwise provided in this Section 13).
13.2 Allocation and Collection.
13.2.1 We have the right to allocate your Marketing Contribution in the proportion that we designate among
the following:
13.2.1.1 the Brand Fund;
13.2.1.2 local marketing, which we may allocate between: (a) any regional marketing fund
established for your area (a “ Regional Fund ”), as provided in Section 13.4 below (but we

spend on local marketing and promotion.
13.2.2 We have the right to periodically make changes to the allocation of the Marketing Contribution as
specified in Section 13.2.1 among those funds and/or local marketing and promotion, by giving you
written notice of the change, and those changes will take effect at the end of that month.
Page 27 of 8013.2.3 No part of the Marketing Contribution (whether deposited in Brand Fund or a Regional Fund or
designated for local marketing and promotional expenditures) shall be subject to refund or
repayment under any circumstances.
13.3 Brand Fund . We have the right (but not the obligation) to establish, maintain, and administer a System wide
marketing and promotional fund (the “ Brand Fund ”). If we establish a Brand Fund, then the following
provisions will apply to that Brand Fund:
13.3.1 We (or our designee) will have the right to direct all marketing programs, with sole discretion over
the concepts, materials, and media used in such programs and the placement and allocation
thereof. You agree and acknowledge that the Brand Fund is intended to maximize general public
recognition, acceptance, and use of the System; and that we and our designee are not obligated, in
administering the Brand Fund, to make expenditures for you that are equivalent or proportionate to
your contribution, or to ensure that any particular franchisee benefits directly or pro rata from
expenditures by the Brand Fund.
13.3.2 The Brand Fund, all contributions to that fund, and any of that fund’s earnings, will be used
exclusively to meet any and all costs of maintaining, administering, staffing, directing, conducting,
preparing advertising, marketing, public relations and/or promotional programs and materials, and
any other activities that we believe will enhance the image of the System (including, among other
things, the costs of preparing and conducting marketing and media advertising campaigns on radio,
television, cable, and other media; direct mail advertising; developing and implementing website,
social networking/media, search optimization, and other electronic marketing strategies; marketing
surveys and other public relations activities; employing marketing personnel (including salaries for
personnel directly engaged in consumer-oriented marketing functions), advertising and/or public

installing signage; and providing promotional and other marketing materials and services to the
Goosehead Businesses operated under the System).
13.3.3 You agree to make your Marketing Contribution to the Brand Fund in the manner specified in
Section 4.3 above. The Brand Fund may also be used to make loans (at reasonable interest rates);
and to provide rebates or reimbursements to franchisees for local expenditures on products,
services, or improvements, approved in advance by us, which products, services, or improvements
we deem, in our sole discretion, will promote general public awareness and favorable support for the
System. All sums you pay to the Brand Fund will be maintained in an account separate from our
other monies and will not be used to defray any of our expenses, except for such reasonable costs
and overhead, if any, as we may incur in activities reasonably related to the direction and
implementation of the Brand Fund and marketing programs for franchisees and the System. The
Brand Fund and its earnings will not
Page 28 of 80otherwise inure to our benefit. We or our designee will maintain separate bookkeeping accounts for
the Brand Fund.
13.3.4 The Brand Fund is not and will not be our asset. We will prepare and make available to you upon
reasonable request an annual statement of the operations of the Brand Fund as shown on our
books.
13.3.5 Although once established the Brand Fund is intended to be of perpetual duration, we maintain the
right to terminate the Brand Fund. The Brand Fund will not be terminated, however, until all monies
in the Brand Fund have been expended for marketing purposes.
13.4 Regional Fund . We have the right to designate any geographical area for purposes of establishing a Regional
Fund. If a Regional Fund for the geographic area in which the Franchised Business is located has been
established at the time you commence operations under this Agreement, you must immediately become a
member of such Regional Fund. If a Regional Fund for the geographic area in which the Franchised Business
is located is established during the term of this Agreement, you must become a member of such Regional
Fund within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Regional Fund commences operation. In no event will
you be required to join more than one Regional Fund. The following provisions will apply to each such
Regional Fund:
13.4.1 Each Regional Fund will be organized and governed in a form and manner, and will commence
operations on a date, all of which we must have approved in advance, in writing.
13.4.2 Each Regional Fund will be organized for the exclusive purpose of administering regional marketing
programs and developing, subject to our approval, standardized promotional materials for use by the
members in regional marketing.
13.4.3 No marketing, advertising or promotional plans or materials may be used by a Regional Fund or
furnished to its members without our prior approval, pursuant to the procedures and terms as set
forth in Section 13.9 below.
13.4.4 Once you become a member of a Regional Fund, you must contribute to a Regional Fund pursuant
to the allocation that we specify, as described in Section 13.2 above, at the time required under
Section 4.3 above, together with such statements or reports that we, or the Regional Fund (with our
prior written approval) may require. We also have the right to require that you submit your Regional
marketing contributions and reports directly to us for distribution to the Regional Brand Fund.
13.4.5 A majority of the Goosehead Business owners in the Regional Fund may vote to increase the
amount of each Goosehead Business owner’s contribution to the Regional Fund by up to an
additional two percent (2%) of each Goosehead Business’s Gross Revenues. Voting will be on the
basis of one vote per Goosehead Business, and each Goosehead Business that we operate in the
region, if any, will have the same voting rights as those owned by our franchisees. You must
contribute to the Regional Fund in accordance with any such vote by the Regional Fund to increase
each Goosehead Business’s contribution as provided in this Section 13.4.5.
13.4.6 Although once established, each Regional Fund is intended to be of perpetual duration, we maintain
the right to terminate any Regional Fund. A Regional Fund will
Page 29 of 80not be terminated, however, until all monies in that Regional Fund have been expended for
marketing purposes.
13.5 Local Marketing and Promotion . You must make Monthly expenditures on local marketing and promotion of
the Franchised Business in such amounts as we may designate as part of the allocation of the Marketing
Contribution specified in Section 13.2 above. As used in this Agreement, the term “local marketing and
promotion” will consist only of the direct costs of purchasing and producing marketing materials (including
camera ready advertising and point of sale materials), media (space or time), and those direct out of pocket
expenses related to costs of marketing and sales promotion that you spend in your local market or area,
advertising agency fees and expenses, postage, shipping, telephone, and photocopying; however, the parties
expressly agree that local marketing may not include costs or expenses that you incur or that are spent on
your behalf in connection with any of the following:

that we may approve; (b) be conducted in a dignified manner; and (c) conform to the standards and
requirements that we may specify. You agree not to use any advertising, marketing materials, and/or
promotional plans unless and until you have received our prior written approval, as specified in Section 13.9
below.
13.8 Our Review and Right to Approve All Proposed Marketing . For all proposed advertising, marketing, and
promotional plans, you (or the Regional Fund, where applicable) must submit to us samples of such plans and

including, without limitation, the requirement that all transferees obtain our approval and meet our
standards as described in Section 16.5.3 above.
16.5.10 The transferor must acknowledge and agree that the transferor will remain bound by the covenants
contained in Sections 19.3 – 19.5 below.
16.5.11 If the transfer involves the sale of all or any part of your book of insurance business (including
Commissions payable in connection with that business), then upon completion of the transfer this
Agreement shall terminate and the transferee must enter into a new form of franchise agreement
that we are then offering to new System franchisees, for a term ending on the expiration date of this
Agreement, and such other ancillary agreements that we may require for the business franchised
under this Agreement.
16.6 Death or Incapacity . Upon the death or mental incapacity of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in
Franchisee, in the Franchised Business, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business:
Page 40 of 8016.6.1 The executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person will transfer such interest to a
third party approved by us within six (6) months after such death or mental incapacity. Such
transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, will be subject to the same
conditions as any inter vivos transfer. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, if the heirs or
beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the conditions in this Section 16, the executor,
administrator, or personal representative of the decedent will transfer the decedent’s interest to
another party approved by us within a reasonable time, which disposition will be subject to all the
terms and conditions for transfers contained in this Agreement. If the interest is not disposed of
within a reasonable time, we may terminate this Agreement, pursuant to Section 17.2 below. Any
transfer subject to this section which is made in accordance with a succession plan approved in
advance by us will be deemed approved for the purposes of this Section 16.6.1. We will not
unreasonably withhold any approvals required by this Section 16.6;
16.6.2 We will have the right to take such steps as are necessary to manage the Franchised Business for
your account until such time as a transfer can be completed pursuant to Section 16.6.1. You further
grant to us the right to receive a reasonable fee for such services and reimbursement for our
expenses in connection with such services.
16.6.3 Our Right to Purchase Business Upon Death or Incapacity .
16.6.3.1 After your death or mental incapacity (or your principal’s death or mental incapacity if
franchisee is an entity), if the transfer of interest described in Section 16.6.1 has not
occurred within six (6) months after such death or mental incapacity, we will have the
option, but not the obligation, to purchase your interest in the Franchised Business. Such
interest may include all rights of yours under this Agreement and all rights of yours in the
lists of customers, prospects and policyholders and all business records and information
regarding those customers, prospects and policyholders, including the name and address
of the applicant or policyholder and the date of expiration and policy limits of any insurance
policy or renewal, rights to solicit the customers, prospects and policyholders for the sale of
insurance products and renewal of policyholders’ current policies, rights to new, renewal or
other commissions and compensation from the insurance carriers or their agents, book of
business, furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved
Location. We may elect not to include the furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights
under the lease for the Approved Location in that purchase. If we intend to exercise this
option, we will notify you (or your appropriate legal representative) within thirty (30) days of
the date we learn of such death or mental incapacity.
16.6.3.2 For assets other than furniture, fixtures or equipment and the rights under the lease for the
Approved Location, the purchase price will be an amount equal to one and one-half times
the Commissions, net of Royalty Fees, received by the Franchised Business during the
twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the closing of the purchase of the assets
by us, but if we re-sell the assets purchased under this Section within six (6) months of our
purchase, the purchase price will be calculated to be ninety percent (90%) of the price for
which we re-sell the business (if more than the original purchase price). The purchase
price will be reduced by any current and long-term liabilities of the Franchised Business
assumed by us and any amounts due to us from you at the time of sale. The purchase
price for
Page 41 of 80furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location (if
we elect to purchase these assets) will be the fair market value as you and we agree. If we
and you (or your appropriate legal representative) cannot agree on the fair market value of
such furniture, fixtures, equipment or the rights under the lease for the Approved Location,
each party will select an independent appraiser who will each provide a written appraisal of
such furniture, fixtures, equipment or rights under the lease for the Approved Location and
we may elect to exercise the option granted hereunder by paying to you the average of the
two appraisals. We will pay the purchase price to you in twelve (12) equal, monthly
installments following the purchase, provided that you are in full compliance with the
covenants contained in this Agreement. If, at any time during the twelve (12) months
following our purchase of your assets, as described above, you breach any covenant
contained in this Agreement (or any other agreement between you and us), our obligation
to pay the monthly installments will immediately cease.
16.6.3.3 We may elect to exercise our option to purchase your interest in the Franchised Business
by sending written notice of the election to you (or your appropriate legal representative).
The election may exclude the purchase of the furniture, fixtures, equipment and rights
under the lease for the Approved Location. The closing of the sale will occur within thirty
(30) days after we exercise our option to purchase the Franchised Business or such later
date as may be necessary to comply with applicable bulk sales or similar laws. At closing,
we and you agree to sign and deliver all documents necessary to vest title in the assets
purchased by us free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except any assumed by us
and/or to effectuate assignment of the lease for the Approved Location. You (or your
appropriate legal representative) must cooperate fully and use your best efforts to acquire
the landlord’s approval of the assignment of the lease for the Approved Location to us, if
necessary. If the lease for the Approved Location cannot be assigned to us, you will agree
to sublease the Approved Location to us on all the same terms and conditions as are
contained in your lease and will cooperate fully and use your best efforts to acquire the
landlord’s approval of the sublease, if necessary. We reserve the right to assign our option
to purchase the Franchised Business or designate a substitute purchaser of the
Franchised Business.
16.7 Consent to Transfer . Our consent to a transfer that is the subject of this Section 16 will not constitute a waiver
of any claims that we may have against the transferring party, nor will it be deemed a waiver of our right to
demand exact compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement by the transferor or transferee.
16.8 No Transfers to a Non-Franchisee  Party to Operate a Similar Business . You agree that neither you nor any
Principal of yours will transfer or attempt to transfer any or all of your Franchised Business to a third party who
will operate a similar business at the Approved Location but not under the System and the Proprietary Marks,
and not under a franchise agreement with us.
16.9 Bankruptcy Issues . If you or any person holding any interest (direct or indirect) in you become a debtor in a
proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar law in the U.S. or elsewhere, it is the parties’
understanding and agreement that any transfer of you, your obligations, and/or rights under this Agreement,
any material assets of yours, and/or
Page 42 of 80any indirect or direct interest in you will be subject to all of the terms of this Section 16, including without
limitation the terms of Sections 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 above.

your affiliates that are required by federal or state law must be submitted to us for review as described below
before such materials are filed with any government agency. Any materials to be used in any exempt offering
must be submitted to us for such review before their use.

below) in connection with the offering.
16.10.3 For each proposed offering, you agree to pay us a non-refundable  fee of Ten Thousand Dollars
($10,000) or such greater amount as is necessary to reimburse us for our reasonable costs and
expenses (including legal and accounting fees) for reviewing the proposed offering.

transaction described in this Section 16.11 commences. Any such offering will be subject to all of the
other provisions of this Section 16, including without limitation the terms set forth in Sections 16.4,
16.5, 16.6; and further, without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any such offering will be
subject to our approval as to the structure and voting control of the offeror (and you, if you are not
the offeror) after the financing is completed.
16.10.5 You also agree that after your initial offering, described above, for the remainder of the term of the
Agreement, you will submit to us for our review and prior written approval all additional securities
documents (including periodic reports, such as quarterly, annual, and special reports) that you
prepare and file (or use) in connection with any such offering. You agree to reimburse us for our
reasonable costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees) that we incur in connection
with our review of those materials.

days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.

(and/or your affiliates) may have in the lease or sublease for the ground upon which the Franchised Business
is operated and/or for the building in which the Franchised Business is operated.

period immediately preceding the closing of the purchase of the assets by us. The purchase price
will be reduced by any current and long-term liabilities of the Franchised Business assumed by us
and any amounts due to us from you at the time of sale. The purchase price for furniture, fixtures,
equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location (if we elect to purchase these
assets) will be the fair market value as you and we agree. If

rights under the lease for the Approved Location. We will pay the purchase price to you in twenty
four (24) equal, monthly installments following the purchase, provided that you are in full compliance
with the covenants contained in this Agreement. If, at any time during the twenty four (24) months
following our purchase of your assets, as described above, you breach any covenant contained in
this Agreement (or any other agreement between you and us), our obligation to pay the monthly
installments will immediately cease. We have the right to offset amounts that you owe to us against
any payment that we may be required to make pursuant to this Section 18.5.

Franchised Business or such later date as may be necessary to comply with applicable bulk sales or
similar laws. At closing, we and you agree to sign and deliver all documents necessary to vest title in
the assets purchased by us free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except any assumed by
us. We reserve the right to assign our repurchase rights described above or designate a substitute
purchaser of the Franchised Business.

operate any other business, that you will not use any reproduction, counterfeit copy, and/or colorable imitation

to cause confusion, mistake, or deception, or which is likely to dilute our rights in and to the Proprietary Marks.

service mark, or representation that suggests or implies a past or present association or connection with us,
the System, the equipment, and/or the Proprietary Marks.

default.

default under this Agreement and/or subsequent to the termination or expiration of this Agreement in
obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 18, which will be in
addition to amounts due to us under Section 18.11 below.

limitation, any copies thereof, even if such copies were made in violation of this Agreement), all of which are
acknowledged to be our property.

we (or our designee) will have the right to enter the Franchised Business (without liability to you, your
Principals, or otherwise) for the purpose continuing the Franchised Business’s operation and maintaining the
goodwill of the business.

you agree to pay to us, as liquidated damages, an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your
monthly Royalty Fees that are due under this Agreement for the twelve (12) months immediately before your
abandonment or our delivery of the notice of default (or, if you have been operating for less than 12 months,
the average of your monthly Royalty Fees for the number of months you have operated the Franchised
Business); (b) multiplied by the lesser of 36 or the number of months remaining in the then-current term of

have any whatsoever interest in, or render services or give advice to, any Competitive Business.
19.4 Where Restrictions Apply . During the term of this Agreement, there is no geographical limitation on the
restrictions set forth in Section 19.3 above. During the two-year period following the expiration, the non-
renewal, or earlier termination of this Agreement, or a transfer as contemplated under Section 16 above,
these restrictions will apply only within the city and county in which the Approved Location is situated. These
restrictions will not apply to businesses that you operate that we (or our affiliates) have franchised to you
pursuant to a valid franchise agreement.
19.5 Post-Term. You further covenant and agree that, for a continuous period of two (2) years after (1) the
expiration of this Agreement, (2) the non-renewal of this Agreement, (3) the termination of this Agreement,
and/or (4) a transfer as contemplated in Section 16 above:
19.5.1 you will not directly or indirectly, for yourself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any
person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity, sell, assign, lease, and/or transfer the
Approved Location to any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity that you know, or
have reason to know, intends to operate a Competitive Business at the Approved Location; and
19.5.2 you will not solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any actual or potential business or customer of
the Franchised Business to any Competitive Business.
19.5.3 You agree that, by the terms of any conveyance, selling, assigning, leasing or transferring your
interest in the Approved Location, you shall include these restrictive covenants as necessary to
ensure that a Competitive Business that would violate this Section is not operated at the Approved
Location for this two-year period, and you will take all steps necessary to ensure that these
restrictive covenants become a matter of public record.
19.6 Periods of Non-Compliance. Any period of non-compliance with the requirements of this Section 19, whether
such non-compliance takes place after termination, expiration, non-renewal, and/or a transfer, will not be
credited toward satisfying the two-year obligation specified above.
19.7 Publicly-Held Entities. Section 19.3.3 above will not apply to your ownership of less than five percent (5%)
beneficial interest in the outstanding equity securities of any publicly-held
Page 50 of 80corporation. As used in this Agreement, the term “ publicly-held  corporation ” will be deemed to refer to a
corporation which has securities that have been registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
19.8 Personal Covenants . You agree to require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in
Sections 9.3, 11, 16, 18 above, and this Section 19 (as modified to apply to an individual), from your
Managers, Producers and other managerial and/or executive staff, as well as your Principals. The covenants
required by this section must be in the form provided in Exhibit F to this Agreement. If you do not obtain
execution of the covenants required by this section and deliver to us those signed covenants, that failure will
constitute a default under Section 17.2.6 above.
19.9 Construction. The parties agree that each of the foregoing covenants will be construed as independent of any
other covenant or provision of this Agreement. We have the right to reduce in writing the scope of any part of
this Section 19 and, if we do so, you agree to comply with the obligations as we have reduced them.
19.10 Claims Not a Defense . You agree that the existence of any claims you may have against us, whether or not
arising from this Agreement, will not constitute a defense to our enforcement of the covenants in this Section
19. You agree to pay all costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur in connection with the enforcement of this
Section 19.
19.11 Covenant as to Anti-Terrorism Laws . You and the owners of your business (“ Owners ”) agree to comply with
and/or to assist us to the fullest extent possible in our efforts to comply with Anti-Terrorism Laws (as defined
below). In connection with such compliance, you and the Owners certify, represent, and warrant that none of
their respective property or interests are “blocked” under any of the Anti-Terrorism Laws and that neither you
nor any of the Owners are in violation of any of the Anti-Terrorism Laws. You also agree not to knowingly hire
or do business with (or continue to employ or do business with) any party who is blocked under any of the
Anti-Terrorism Laws. The term “Anti-Terrorism Laws ” means Executive Order 13224 issued by the President
of the United States, as supplemented, the USA PATRIOT Act, and all other laws and regulations addressing
or in any way relating to terrorist acts and/or acts of war.
19.12 Defaults. You acknowledge and agree that your violation of the terms of this Section 19 would result in
irreparable injury to us for which no adequate remedy at law may be available, and you accordingly consent to
the issuance of an injunction prohibiting any conduct in violation of the terms of this Section 19.
20 TAXES, PERMITS, AND INDEBTEDNESS
20.1 Payment of Taxes . You agree to promptly pay when due all taxes levied or assessed, including, without
limitation, unemployment and sales taxes, and all accounts and other indebtedness of every kind that you
incur in the conduct of the business franchised under this Agreement. You agree to pay us an amount equal
to any sales tax, gross receipts tax, or similar tax imposed on us with respect to any payments that you make
to us as required under this Agreement, unless the tax is credited against income tax that we otherwise pay to
a state or federal authority.
20.2 Payment of Trade Creditors . You agree to promptly pay when due all trade creditors and vendors (including
any that are affiliated with us) that supply goods or services to you and/or the Franchised Business.
Page 51 of 8020.3 Your Right to Contest Liabilities . If there is a bona fide dispute as to your liability for taxes assessed or other
indebtedness, you may contest the validity or the amount of the tax or indebtedness in accordance with
procedures of the taxing authority or applicable law; however, in no event will you permit a tax sale or seizure
by levy of execution or similar writ or warrant, or attachment by a creditor, to occur against the premises of the
Franchised Business, or any improvements thereon.
20.4 Compliance with Law. You agree to comply with all federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, and to
timely obtain any and all permits, certificates, or licenses necessary for the full and proper conduct of the
business franchised under this Agreement, including, without limitation, licenses to do business, health
certificates, fictitious name registrations, sales tax permits, and fire clearances. To the extent that the
requirements of any such laws are in conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Manual, or our other
instructions, you agree to: (a) comply with said laws; (b) immediately provide us with written notice describing
the nature of the conflict; and (c) cooperate with us and our counsel in developing a way to comply with the
terms of this Agreement, as well as applicable law, to the extent that it is possible to do so.
20.5 Notice of Violations and Actions . You agree to notify us in writing within five (5) days after: (a) you receive
notice of any health or safety violation, the commencement of any action, suit, or proceeding, and of the
issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award, or decree of any court, agency, or other governmental
instrumentality, (b) the occurrence of any accident or injury which may adversely affect the operation of the
Franchised Business or your financial condition, or give rise to liability or a claim against either party to this
Agreement, or (c) the discovery of any facts that may give rise to a professional liability claim against either
party to this Agreement.
21 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND INDEMNIFICATION
21.1 Independent Contractor Relationship. The parties acknowledge and agree that:
21.1.1 this Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship between them;
21.1.2 you are the only party that will be in day-to-day control of your franchised business, even though we
will share the brand and Proprietary Marks as specified in this Agreement, and neither this
Agreement nor any of the systems, guidance, computer programs, processes, or requirements
under which you operate alter that basic fact;
21.1.3 nothing in this Agreement and nothing in our course of conduct is intended to make either party an
agent, legal representative, subsidiary, joint venturer, partner, employee, or servant of the other for
any purpose whatsoever; and
21.1.4 neither this Agreement nor our course of conduct is intended, nor may anything in this Agreement
(nor our course of conduct) be construed, to state or imply that we are the employer of your
employees and/or independent contractors, nor vice versa
21.2 Notice of Status . At all times during the term of this Agreement and any extensions hereof, you will hold
yourself out to the public as an independent contractor operating the business pursuant to a franchise from
us. You agree to take such action as may be necessary to do so, including, without limitation, exhibiting a
notice of that fact in a conspicuous place at the Approved Location, the content of which we reserve the right
to specify.
Page 52 of 8021.3 No Contracts in our Name . It is understood and agreed that, except as may be necessary for you to provide
Products or Services to customers using the Proprietary Marks, nothing in this Agreement authorizes you to
make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on our behalf, or to incur any debt or other
obligation in our name; and that we will in no event assume liability for, or be deemed liable under this
Agreement as a result of, any such action; nor will we be liable by reason of any act or omission in your
conduct of the Franchised Business or for any claim or judgment arising therefrom against either party to this
Agreement.
21.4 Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Franchisor Parties against any and all
Damages arising directly or indirectly from any Asserted Claim as well as from your breach of this Agreement.
Your indemnity obligations will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and will not be affected
by the presence of any applicable insurance policies and coverages that we may maintain.
21.5 Definitions. As used in Section 21.4 above, the parties agree that the following terms will have the following
meanings:
21.5.1 “Asserted  Claim” means any allegation, claim or complaint that is the result of, or in connection
with, your exercise of your rights and/or carrying out of your obligations under this Agreement
(including any claim associated with your operation of the Franchised Business or otherwise), or any
default by you under this Agreement, notwithstanding any claim that any Franchisor Party was or
may have been negligent.
21.5.2 “Franchisor Parties ” means us, our shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.
21.5.3 “Damages” means all claims, demands, causes of action, suits, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties,
assessments, judgments, losses, and expenses (including without limitation expenses, costs and
lawyers’ fees incurred for any indemnified party’s primary defense or for enforcement of its
indemnification rights).
22 FORCE MAJEURE

by causes beyond its control, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) acts of nature; (b)
acts of war, terrorism, or insurrection; (c) strikes, lockouts, labor actions, boycotts, floods, fires, hurricanes,
tornadoes, and/or other casualties; and/or (d) our inability (and that of our affiliates and/or suppliers) to
manufacture, purchase, and/or cause delivery of any services or products used in the operation of the
Franchised Business.
22.2 Transmittal of Funds. The inability of either party to obtain and/or remit funds will be considered within control
of such party for the purpose of Section 22.1 above. If any such delay occurs, any applicable time period will
be automatically extended for a period equal to the time lost; provided, however, that the party affected makes
reasonable efforts to correct the reason for such delay and gives to the other party prompt notice of any such
delay; and further provided, however, that you will remain obligated to promptly pay all fees owing and due to
us under this Agreement, without any such delay or extension.
Page 53 of 8023 APPROVALS AND WAIVERS

timely written request to us therefor, and such approval or consent must be obtained in writing.
23.2 No Warranties or Guarantees . You acknowledge and agree that we make no warranties or guarantees upon
which you may rely, and that we assume no liability or obligation to you, by providing any waiver, approval,

of any request therefor.
23.3 No Waivers . No delay, waiver, omission, or forbearance on our part to exercise any right, option, duty, or
power arising out of any breach or default by you or any other franchisee under any of the terms, provisions,
covenants, or conditions of this Agreement, and no custom or practice by the parties at variance with the
terms of this Agreement, will constitute our waiver of our right to enforce any such right, option, duty, or power
as against you, or as to subsequent breach or default by you. If we accept late payments from you or any
payments due, that will not be deemed to be our waiver of any earlier or later breach by you of any terms,
provisions, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement. No course of dealings or course of conduct will be
effective to amend the terms of this Agreement.
24 NOTICES
Any and all notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and must be personally

rejected delivery, or attempted delivery to the respective parties at the addresses shown on the signature
page of this Agreement, unless and until a different address has been designated by written notice to the
other party. Any notice by a means that gives the sender evidence of delivery, rejected delivery, or delivery
that is not possible because the recipient moved and left no forwarding address will be deemed to have been
given at the date and time of receipt, rejected, and/or attempted delivery. The Manual, any changes that we
make to the Manual, and/or any other written instructions that we provide relating to operational matters, are
not considered to be “notices” for the purpose of the delivery requirements in this Section 24.

other than the words of this Agreement (and the FDD) before deciding whether to sign this Agreement; and
(b) they relied only on the words printed in this Agreement in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement.

amendments to the FDD.
25.2 Amendment. Except for those changes that we are permitted to make unilaterally under this Agreement, no
amendment, change, or variance from this Agreement will be binding on either party unless mutually agreed

this Agreement as if they were printed here.

provision of this Agreement will be considered severable; and if, for any reason, any section, part, term,
and/or provision herein is determined to be invalid and contrary to, or in conflict with, any existing or future law
or regulation by a court or agency having valid jurisdiction, such will not impair the operation of, or have any

27 APPLICABLE LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
27.1 Choice of Law. This Agreement takes effect when we accept and sign this document. This Agreement will be
interpreted and construed exclusively under the laws of the State of Texas, which laws will prevail in the event
of any conflict of law (without regard to, and without giving effect to, the application of Texas choice-of-law
rules); provided, however, that if the covenants in Section 19 of this Agreement would not be enforced as
written under
Page 55 of 80Texas law, then the parties agree that those covenants will instead be interpreted and construed under the
laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located. Nothing in this Section 27.1 is intended by the
parties to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, implied covenant, unfair
competition, fiduciary, and/or other doctrine of law of the State of Texas (or any other state) that would not
otherwise apply without this Section 27.1.
27.2 Choice of Venue. Subject to Section 27.3 below, the parties agree that any action that you bring against us, in
any court, whether federal or state, must be brought only within the state and judicial district in which we
maintain our principal place of business. Any action that we bring against you in any court, whether federal or
state, may be brought within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business.
27.2.1 The parties agree that this Section 27.2 will not be construed as preventing either party from
removing an action from state to federal court; provided, however, that venue will be as set forth
above.
27.2.2 The parties hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying
out this provision.
27.2.3 Any such action will be conducted on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common,
or class action.
27.3 Mediation. Before any party may bring an action in court against the other, the parties agree that they must
first meet to mediate the dispute (except as otherwise provided in Section 27.5 below). Any such mediation will
be non-binding and will be conducted in accordance with the then-current rules for mediation of commercial
disputes of JAMS, Inc. (formerly, “Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.”) at its location nearest to
our then-current principal place of business.
27.4 Parties Rights Are Cumulative. No right or remedy conferred upon or reserved to us or you by this Agreement
is intended to be, nor will be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy herein or by law or equity
provided or permitted, but each will be cumulative of every other right or remedy.
27.5 Injunctions. Nothing contained in this Agreement will bar our right to obtain injunctive relief in a court of
competent jurisdiction against threatened conduct that will cause us loss or damages, under the usual equity
rules, including the applicable rules for obtaining restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.
27.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIALS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER OF THEM AGAINST THE
OTHER, WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER PARTIES IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
27.7 MUST BRING CLAIMS WITHIN ONE YEAR. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AGREES THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS
AND ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS A GREEMENT, THE PARTIES’ RELATIONSHIP, AND/OR YOUR
OPERATION OF THE F RANCHISED B USINESS, BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY HERETO AGAINST THE OTHER, SHALL BE
COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1)  YEAR FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION,
OR, IT IS EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGED AND AGREED BY ALL PARTIES, SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION SHALL BE IRREVOCABLY
BARRED.
Page 56 of 8027.8 WAIVER OF PUNITIVE D AMAGES. EACH PARTY TO THIS A GREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM OF ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER, AND
AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM EACH SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL
DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY IT.
27.9 Payment of Legal Fees . You agree to pay us all damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation
reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur after
the termination or expiration of the franchise granted under this Agreement in: (a) obtaining injunctive or other
relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation Sections 9 and 17
above); and/or (b) successfully defending a claim from you that we misrepresented the terms of this
Agreement, fraudulently induced you to sign this Agreement, that the provisions of this Agreement are not fair,
were not properly entered into, and/or that the terms of this Agreement (as it may be amended by its terms)
do not exclusively govern the parties’ relationship.

SITE SELECTION ADDENDUM
Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC (“ Franchisor ” or “ us” or “ we”) and (“Franchisee ” or “ you”) have this day of ,
201 entered into a Goosehead Insurance Franchise Agreement (“ Franchise Agreement ”) and wish to supplement
its terms as set out below in this Site Selection Addendum (the “ Addendum ”). The parties agree as follows:
AGREEMENT
1. Time to Locate Site : Within ninety (90) days after the date of this Addendum, you agree to acquire or
lease/sublease, at your own expense, commercial real estate that is properly zoned for the use of the business that
you will conduct under the Franchise Agreement (the “ Franchised Business ”) at a site that we will have approved
in writing as provided below.
a. Such location must be within the following area: (the “Site Selection Area ”).
b. The only reason that the Site Selection Area is described is for the purpose of selecting a site for the
Franchised Business.
c. For purposes of this Addendum, the term “ Search Period ” means ninety (90) days from the date of this
Addendum, or the period from the date of this Addendum until we have approved of a location for your Franchised
Business, whichever event first occurs.
d. If you do not acquire or lease a site (that we have approved in writing) for the Franchised Business in
accordance with this Addendum by not later than ninety (90) days after the date of this Addendum, that will constitute
a default under Section 17.2 of the Franchise Agreement and also under this Addendum, and we will have the right
to terminate the Franchise Agreement and this Addendum pursuant to the terms of Section 17.2 of the Franchise
Agreement.
2. Site Evaluation Services : We will provide you with our site selection guidelines, including our minimum
standards for a location for the Franchised Business, and such site selection counseling and assistance as we may
deem advisable. If we deem on-site evaluation to be necessary and appropriate, we will conduct up to two (2) on-site
evaluations at our cost and expense. If we perform any additional on-site evaluations, you must reimburse us, as
applicable, for all reasonable expenses that we incur in connection with such on-site evaluation, including, without
limitation, the cost of travel, lodging and meals. We will not provide on site evaluation for any proposed site before
we have received from you a completed site approval form for the site (prepared as set forth in Section 3 below).
3. Site Selection Package Submission and Approval : You must submit to us, in the form that we specify: (a) a
completed site approval form (in the form that we require); (b) such other information or materials that we may
reasonably require; and (c) an option contract, letter of intent, or other evidence satisfactory to us that confirms your
favorable prospects for obtaining the site. You acknowledge that time is of the essence. We will have thirty (30) days
after receipt of all such information and materials from you to approve or disapprove the proposed site as the
location for the Franchised Business. We have the right to approve or disapprove any such site to serve as the
Page 74 of 80Approved Location for the Franchised Business. If we do not approve a proposed site by giving you written notice
within the 30-day period, then we will be deemed to have disapproved the site.
4. Lease Responsibilities : After we have approved a site and before the expiration of the Search Period, you must
execute a lease, which must be coterminous with the Franchise Agreement, or a binding agreement to purchase the
site. Our approval of any lease is conditioned upon inclusion in the lease of the Lease Rider  attached to the
Franchise Agreement as Exhibit H. However, even if we examine the Lease, we are not responsible for review of the
Lease for any terms other than those contained in the Lease Rider.
5. Approved Location : After we have approved the location for the Franchised Business and you have leased or
acquired that location, the location will constitute the Approved Location  described in Section 1.2 of the Franchise
Agreement. The Approved Location will be specified on Exhibit A to the Franchise Agreement, and will become a part
the Franchise Agreement.
a. You Franchisee hereby acknowledge and agree that our approval of a site does not constitute an assurance,
representation, or warranty of any kind, express or implied, as to the suitability of the site for the Franchised
Business or for any other purpose. Our approval of the site indicates only that we believe the site complies with our
minimum acceptable criteria solely for our own purposes as of the time of the evaluation. The parties each
acknowledge that application of criteria that have been effective with respect to other sites and premises may not be
predictive of potential for all sites and that, subsequent to our approval of a site, demographic and/or economic
factors, such as competition from other similar businesses, included in or excluded from criteria that we used could
change, thereby altering the potential of a site. Such factors are unpredictable and are beyond our control.
b. We will not be responsible for the failure of a site (even if we have approved that site) to meet your
expectations as to revenue or operational criteria.
c. You acknowledge and agree that your acceptance of a franchise for the operation of the Franchised Business
at the site is based on its own independent investigation of the suitability of the site.
6. Construction : This Addendum will be considered an integral part of the Franchise Agreement between the
parties hereto, and the terms of this Addendum will be controlling with respect to the subject matter hereof. All
capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the same meaning as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.
Except as modified or supplemented by this Addendum, the terms of the Franchise Agreement are hereby ratified
and confirmed.

LEASE RIDER
THIS ADDENDUM (the “ Addendum ”) has been executed as of this day of , 201 , by and between (“Franchisee ”)

Business at the Premises, and as a condition to obtaining Franchisor’s approval of the Lease, the Lease for the
Premises must contain the provisions contained in this Addendum.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of mutual covenants set forth herein, the execution and delivery of the Lease,
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord
and Franchisee hereby agree as follows:
1. Landlord agrees to deliver to Franchisor a copy of any notice of default or termination of the Lease at the same
time such notice is delivered to Franchisee. Franchisor agrees to deliver to Landlord a copy of any notice of
termination under the Franchise Agreement. Franchisee hereby consents to that exchange of information by
Landlord and Franchisor.
2. Franchisee hereby assigns to Franchisor, with Landlord’s irrevocable and unconditional consent, all of
Franchisee’s rights, title and interests to and under the Lease upon any termination or non-renewal of the
Franchise Agreement, but no such assignment will be effective unless and until: (a) the Franchise Agreement is
terminated or expires without renewal; (b) Franchisor has exercised its Option to Purchase under the Franchise
Agreement; and (c) Franchisor notifies the Franchisee and Landlord in writing that Franchisor assumes
Franchisee’s obligations under the Lease.
3. Franchisor will have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any breach of the Lease (within fifteen (15)
business days after the expiration of the period in which Franchisee had to cure any such default should
Franchisee fail to do so) upon giving written notice of its election to Franchisee and Landlord, and, if so stated
in the notice, to also succeed to Franchisee’s rights, title and interests thereunder. The Lease may not be
modified, amended, supplemented, renewed, extended or assigned by Franchisee without Franchisor’s prior
written consent.
4. Franchisee and Landlord acknowledge and agree that Franchisor will have no liability or obligation whatsoever
under the Lease unless and until Franchisor assumes the Lease in writing pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3,
above.
5. If Franchisor assumes the Lease, as provided above, Franchisor may, without Landlord’s prior consent, further
assign the Lease to another franchisee of Franchisor to operate a “Goosehead Insurance” business at the

Franchisor and its employees or agents will have the right to enter the Premises for certain purposes. Landlord
hereby agrees not to interfere with or prevent such entry by Franchisor, its employees or agents. Landlord and
Franchisee hereby further acknowledge that if the Franchise Agreement expires (without renewal) or is
terminated, Franchisee is obligated to take certain steps under the Franchise Agreement to de-identify the
Premises as a “Goosehead Insurance” business (unless Franchisor takes an assignment of the lease, as
provided above). Landlord agrees to permit Franchisor, its employees or agent, to enter the Premises and
remove signs (both interior and exterior), décor and materials displaying any marks, designs or logos owned by
Franchisor, provided that Franchisor will bear the expense of repairing any damage to the Premises as a result
thereof.
7. If Landlord is an affiliate or an Owner of Franchisee, Landlord and Franchisee agree that if Landlord proposes
to sell the Premises, before the sale of the Premises, upon the request of Franchisor the Lease will be amended
to reflect a rental rate and other terms that are the reasonable and customary rental rates and terms prevailing
in the community where the “Goosehead Insurance” business is located.

FRANCHISE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
In recognition of the requirements of California’s Franchise Investment Law and the California Franchise Relations Act, the
Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC Franchise Disclosure Document shall be supplemented as follows:
1. California Corporations Code, Section 31125, requires Franchisor to give Franchisee a disclosure document,
approved by the Department of Business Oversight, before a solicitation of a proposed material modification of an
existing franchise.
2. THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE INVESTMENT LAW REQUIRES THAT A COPY OF ALL PROPOSED
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE SALE OF THE FRANCHISE BE DELIVERED TOGETHER WITH THE
DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.
3. Item 3 of the Franchise Disclosure Document is modified by adding the following paragraph to the end thereof:
Neither Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC nor any person listed in Item 2 of this Franchise
Disclosure Document is subject to any currently effective order of any national securities
association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
U.S.C.A. 78a et seq., suspending or expelling these persons from membership in this association
or exchange.
4. Item 17 of the Franchise Disclosure Document is modified by adding the following paragraphs to the end of Item 17:
California Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through 20043 provide rights to Franchisee
concerning termination, transfer or non-renewal of a franchise. If the Franchise Agreement contains a provision
that is inconsistent with the law, the law will control.
The Franchise Agreement provides for termination upon bankruptcy. This provision may not be enforceable
under federal bankruptcy law (11 U.S.C.A. Sec. 101 et seq.).
The Franchise Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond the termination of the
franchise. This provision may not be enforceable under California law.
Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of
California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5, Code of Civil
Procedure
FDD Exhibit H-1Section 1281, and the Federal Arbitration Act) to any provisions of a franchise agreement
restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.
The Franchise Agreement requires application of the laws of the State of Texas. This provision
may not be enforceable under California law.
The Franchise Agreement requires Franchisee to sign a general release of claims upon renewal or
transfer of the Franchise Agreement. California Corporations Code Section 31512 provides that
any condition, stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring any franchise to
waive compliance with any provision of that law or any rule or order thereunder is void. Section
31512 voids a waiver of Franchisee’s rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California
Corporations Code Section 31000–31516). Business and Professions Code Section 20010
voids a waiver of Franchisee’s rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions
Code Sections 20000–20043).

APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. ANY COMPLAINTS

Investment Law or the California Franchise Relations Act are met independently of and without reference to this
Addendum. This Addendum shall have no effect if the jurisdictional requirements of the California Franchise
Investment Law or the California Franchise Relations Act are not met.

evidence thereof to us. You may avoid termination by immediately initiating a remedy to cure such
default and curing it to our satisfaction within the sixty-day period, and by promptly providing
proof thereof to us. If any such default is not cured within the specified time, or such longer period
as applicable law may require, this Agreement will terminate without further notice to you,
effective immediately upon the expiration of the sixty-day period or such longer period as
applicable law may require. You will be in default pursuant to this Section 17.3 for failure
substantially to comply with any of the requirements imposed by this Agreement, as it may from
time to time reasonably be supplemented by the Manual, or failure to carry out the terms of this
Agreement in good faith. Such defaults include, but are not limited to, the following illustrative
events:
2. This Amendment shall be effective only to the extent that jurisdictional requirements of the California Franchise
Investment Law or the California Franchise Relations Act are met independently of and without reference to this
Amendment. This Amendment shall have no effect if the jurisdictional requirements of the California Franchise
Investment Law or the California Franchise Relations Act are not met.

Business or the Premises or their actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business.

such business’ actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business.

from us.
3.6. Method of Payment. You must make all payments to us by the method or methods that we specify from time to time. We require
payment via wire transfer or electronic debit to your bank account, and you must maintain sufficient balance in your operating account to meet the
payment requirements. You must furnish us and your bank with all authorizations necessary to effect payment by the methods we specify. You may
not, under any circumstances, set off, deduct or otherwise withhold any Royalty fees, Advertising Contributions, interest charges, or any other
monies payable under this Agreement on grounds of our alleged non-performance of any obligations. Additionally, you authorize us to charge
against any of your credit cards any amounts due to us or to any of our affiliates. You agree to supply us a written list of all of your credit cards
(including card number, name, and expiration date) and to update that list periodically, if there are changes to the information.

from the date such amount was due until paid in full. Unpaid interest charges will compound annually. In addition, we will have the right to charge a
late fee for each occurrence of a payment that is more than 30 days past due, which fee will be $100 for the first such occurrence, $200 for the
second such occurrence, and $300 for the third and each subsequent occurrence during the Term of this Agreement. The late fee is to compensate
us for our administrative costs incurred in enforcing your obligation to pay us.
3.8. Dishonored Payments. For any amount that you must pay to us or our affiliates, if we are not able to successfully complete a wire
transfer or electronic debit for such payment as described Section 3.6 [Method of Payment]  above, or if a check that you issue for such payment is
returned by the bank against which it was drawn, due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s) or any other reason
resulting in the nonpayment (each a “ Dishonored Payment”), we have the right to charge a fee of $100 per occurrence (a “ Dishonored Payment
Charge”). We will notify you of each Dishonored Payment and any Dishonored Payment Charge that we impose. We may add the Dishonored
Payment Charge to the amount to be paid via the next wire transfer or electronic debit. The Dishonored Payment Charge applies in addition to any
late fee and interest that we have the right to charge, or any other remedy to which we are entitled, under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.
3.9 Taxes. You are responsible for all taxes levied or assessed on you or the Franchised Business in connection with your activities under

may assert.

our security interest, including but not limited to a UCC-1 Financing Statement. Alternatively, you authorize us to execute any of the foregoing
financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments, and/or other documents on your behalf, or on our own (in our name),
describing the collateral in such manner as we consider appropriate. You hereby grant us an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest,
to execute, in your name, any of such financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments or other documents. You must
pay all filing fees and costs for perfecting our security interest.
4. SITE SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND OPENING DEADLINE
4.1. Site Selection and Approval. You will be responsible, at your own expense, for finding and then acquiring, by lease or purchase, a
suitable site at which to develop and operate your Franchised Business (the “ Premises ”). Any sites that you propose must be within the area
identified in Exhibit A (the “Site Selection Area”). You acknowledge and agree that: (a) the sole purpose of designating a Site Selection Area is to
identify the geographic area in which you intend (and, upon our written approval, will be authorized) to operate a Franchised Business under the

specifications, prepared at your expense, when the Approved Location will not accommodate our standard plans and specifications, provided that
such plans and specifications conform to our general design criteria. You will be responsible for the design and layout that your architect or
engineer prepares. If we express an opinion about the plans or indicate our approval, it will be merely for the purpose of our own determination that
your plans will satisfy our internal standards, specifications, and layout. We will not be in a position to provide any assurances, and therefore can

necessary to determine for yourself whether a particular location and the terms of any lease, sublease, or purchase agreement for the site are
beneficial and acceptable to you.

actually open the Franchised Business is the “ Opening Date.”

responsibilities (each a “ Manager Trainee”) must all successfully attend (at the same time) and successfully complete our initial training program
(we may designate portions of the training program that each person must attend and successfully complete), which is held at our headquarters
and/or another location(s) that we specify. One Manager Trainee must be your Operating Principal (who meets the criteria in Section 6.15 of this
Agreement), unless we mutually agree otherwise. You may designate another person who will be active in the day-to-day activities and
management of the Franchised Business to be the second Manager Trainee. You may ask that additional employees be allowed to attend the
portions of the initial training that are designed for your employees, and we will have the right to approve or disapprove that request. All trainees
must be persons that we find acceptable at all times to serve in their respective capacities. As of the Effective Date, our training program has two
components, as follows:
(a) An Advanced Operations Course for your Operating Principal, which consists of up to twelve days for your
Operating Principal and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing.
(b) A Basic Operations Course for any Manager Trainee other than your Operating Principal, which consists of up to
twelve days of training and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing.
Your Manager Trainees (other than your Operating Principal), and such of the Franchisee’s other employees as we designate must attend this
component of training.
5.1.2. We will issue a certificate of completion for each Manager Trainee who completes the initial training program we require to
our satisfaction (each such person will be referred to as a “ Certified Manager”). We have the right to determine whether a person has or has not
successfully completed training. If you (or your personnel) fail to complete initial training to our satisfaction, we may permit you (or they) to repeat
the course or allow you to send a substitute to the next available scheduled training session; however, we will have no obligation to extend the
opening deadline in Section 4 for this purpose.
Page 10 of 39
Source: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/20155.1.3. We have the right to reduce the duration or content of the training program for any trainee who has prior experience with
our concept or in similar businesses. We also may allow you to train certain of your managers (which may include Certified Managers) and
successors in those positions at your location.
5.1.4. Failure to complete the initial training program constitutes grounds for termination, as provided in Section 15 of this
Agreement.

additional training courses during the Term of this Agreement at a location that we specify (including an annual conference for franchisees in the

Business, and we will provide such training if we determine that we are able to do so. We may charge you a training fee and our out-of-pocket
expenses for all additional training programs, whether mandatory or optional, or whether you request or we require such training, which fee shall be
as set forth in the Manual or otherwise in writing.
5.4. Training by You. We have the right to specify training programs related to the System that you must conduct for your employees
using approved training materials or that we will provide at our headquarters. For any training of your personnel that we conduct, you are
responsible for expenses incurred while they attend training, including salaries, benefits, travel, lodging, meals, and other related expenses. We
reserve the right to charge you for training additional personnel.
5.5. Training Materials and Methods. All training materials that we provide to you remain our property. We have the right to provide
training programs in person, on tape, via the Internet or other electronic means, or by other means and media, as we determine.
5.6. Expenses. We will provide instructors, facilities, and materials for the initial training program at no charge, provided that all of your
personnel are trained during the same training session. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for training additional personnel (in excess
of two), re-training persons who are repeating the course or replacing a person who did not pass. For all training, including initial training, you are
responsible for any travel expenses, living expenses, wages, and other expenses incurred by your trainees.
6. OPERATIONS
6.1. Compliance with Standards. You agree to comply with all mandatory specifications and procedures set forth from time to time in our
confidential operating manual (the “ Manual”). You acknowledge that the accounting practices, record keeping, software, services, and operation of

6.4.2. If you would like to use or offer food items (other than the Secret Recipe Products), equipment, supplies, materials, and
other products and services that we have not approved, or purchase from a vendor, supplier, distributor, or other source (together, “supplier(s)”)
that we have not approved, then you must submit to us a written request for approval. We have the ongoing right to inspect any proposed
supplier’s facilities and to test samples of the proposed products or services. You agree to pay us an amount not to exceed the reasonable cost of
the inspection and our actual cost of testing the proposed product or service, including personnel and travel costs, whether or not we ultimately
approve the supplier. We have the right to grant, deny, or revoke approval of products, services, and suppliers. We will notify you in writing of our
decision as soon as practicable following our evaluation. We reserve the right to reinspect the facilities and products of any approved supplier and
to revoke approval if we find that the supplier fails to meet any of our then-current criteria. If you receive a notice of revocation of approval, you
agree to immediately stop buying products or services from the disapproved supplier and, in the case of revocation based on failure of products to
meet our standards, you agree to dispose of your remaining inventory of the disapproved supplier’s products as we direct.
6.4.3. If you wish to test market an item that we have not approved, then, so long as we have given you our prior written
approval, you may do so for so long, and on such terms, that we mutually agree upon (a “ Test”), and the item so tested, and all associated
formulae, plans, and materials, will become our property. If, following the Test, we determine that we will approve the tested item, then for so long as
we deem that item to be an “approved item” under this Agreement, you will have the right to use that item under the terms of this Agreement; and
we will have the right to use and market that item as we see fit, including but not limited to use in our own Restaurants as well as that of other
licensees and franchisees, without compensation to you. You agree to sign such documents (and require your employees and any independent
contractors that you have engaged to sign such documents) as we may require in order to implement the provisions of this Section 6.4.3 [Sourcing
of Other Products, Equipment and Supplies] .
6.4.4. We and our affiliates may receive payments or other compensation from suppliers on account of such suppliers’ dealings
with you and other franchisees; and, we may use all amounts so received for any purpose we and our affiliates deem appropriate.
6.5. Delivery Vehicles . If you wish to use a vehicle to provide delivery services (a “ Delivery Vehicle”) as part of your Franchised
Business, you must comply with the specifications and standards that we may periodically prescribe in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles. Our
specifications and standards may include, among other things: designating Delivery Vehicles specific make and model; limitations on the Useful
Life for a Delivery Vehicle and standards for maintenance or repair services.

Business. We have the right to determine the Useful Life of any Delivery Vehicle, which may include reasonable standards as to how many model
years old the vehicle may be, the appearance of the vehicle, and the performance of the vehicle. After the Useful Life, you must remove all
Proprietary Marks and any other indicia associating the Delivery Vehicle with the System, and immediately purchase or lease a new Delivery Vehicle.
6.5.2. We have the right to specify the makes and models of Delivery Vehicles approved for use by our franchisees, and

all licenses and permits required to sell, dispense, and store beer and wine beverages and be prepared to offer and sell such beer and wine products
to customers at the Premises as we designate as mandatory product offerings, unless you obtain from us a written waiver of this requirement. You
must comply with all laws and regulations relating to the selling, dispensing, and storing of alcoholic beverages. You must also comply with the
standards, specifications, and terms that we may establish regarding the offer, sale, and presentation of alcoholic beverages, as require or approved

establish.

Business, including hiring, firing, compensation, benefits, work hours, work rules, record-keeping, supervision, and discipline of employees. You
must take such steps as are necessary to ensure that your employees preserve good customer relations; render competent, prompt, courteous, and
knowledgeable service; and meet any minimum standards that we may establish from time to time in the Manual, which may include standards as to
the minimum number of employees, which we may determine, necessary to meet the anticipated volume of business and to achieve the goals of the
System.
6.10. Customer Service Program . You acknowledge that providing superior customer service is a vital component of the System. You
must participate in customer service programs, which we have the right to specify from time to time in the Manual. Such programs may include the

any remedial actions we require and pay us all expenses we incurred to have the evaluation service evaluate the Franchised Business, and all
expenses we may have incurred to inspect the Franchised Business thereafter.

“Customer List”) containing as to each of your customers, such customer’s name, e-mail address, location address, telephone number and zip

is, and remains, our exclusive property, you hereby assign to us all rights you now have or hereafter may acquire in the Customer List. After the

6.12.1. You acknowledge that our negotiation of Major Accounts, including rates and services to be performed, enhances the
potential value of the System and inures to your benefit as well as to our benefit and that of other Restaurant franchisees. As noted in Section 1.3
[Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights]  above, we reserve the right to provide products and services to all Major Accounts. We may offer you
the right to provide products and services to a Major Account within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area. If you accept the obligation to
provide products and services to a Major Account, you must service such Major Account on our behalf, in accordance with the pricing and other
terms that we negotiate with the Major Account customer. You may not enter into any relationship with a Major Account customer that we deem to
conflict with the customer’s Major Account arrangement with us. We will have the right to handle all billing and collection for services performed
under a Major Account arrangement. Certain Major Account customers may require that we provide additional volume rebates, which we will
negotiate with the customer on a case-by-case basis. You will have the option not to provide products or services to any Major Account customer
that is offered to you.
6.12.2. We may terminate your right to provide products and services to a Major Account customer at any time by giving you at
least 30 days’ prior written notice, and you may terminate your right to provide products and services to a Major Account at any time by giving us
at least 30 days’ prior written notice. If we elect not to offer you the opportunity to provide products or services to a Major Account, if you decline
the option to accept a Major Account, if your right to provide products or services to a Major Account terminates, or if you fail to satisfy the
conditions and obligations of any Major Account agreement, we have the right to service and/or authorize others to service Major Account
customers within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area without any compensation to you. We have no obligation to permit you to provide
products or services to a Major Account or to transfer any Major Account customer to you if you are subsequently willing and able to provide
service.
6.13. Inspections. We have the right, at any time during normal business hours: (i) to conduct inspections of the Franchised Business; (ii)
to interview your employees, work crews, and customers; and (iii) to review your business records, including those maintained electronically or off
premises. We can initiate these actions with or without prior notice to you. You must cooperate with such inspections by giving our representatives
unrestricted access and rendering such assistance as our representatives may reasonably request. If we notify you of any deficiencies after the
inspection, you must promptly take steps to correct them. If you fail to correct any deficiencies within a reasonable time, we have the right to
correct such deficiencies and to invoice you for our expenses.
6.14. Compliance with Laws. You agree to operate the Franchised Business in full compliance with all applicable municipal, county, state,
and federal laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances. You have sole responsibility for such compliance despite any information or advice that we
may provide. (To the extent that the requirements of those laws are in conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Manuals, or our other
instructions, you must: (a) comply with those laws; and (b) immediately give us written notice of the conflict.)

business decisions related to the Franchised Business, and must have the power to bind you in all dealings with us. You may not change the
Operating Principal without our prior approval.

Operating Principal who is a Certified Manager, or another individual who is a Certified Manager. You may not permit the Franchised Business to be
operated, managed, directed, or controlled by any other person without our prior written consent. At least one Certified Manager must devote, on a
full-time basis, his or her best efforts to managing and operating the Franchised Business. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, before the
Operating Principal or any other manager may manage the Franchised Business, he or she must become a Certified Manager (as provided in Section
5.1.2 [Initial Training Program] ) and acquire any food-safety-program certification that the local, state or municipality may require, as well as any
other licenses, permits, and certifications that we may require from time to time.
6.15.3 If the Certified Manager is an individual other than Operating Principal, and such Certified Manager ceases to satisfy his
or her obligations under this Agreement due to death, disability, termination of employment, or for any other reason, the Operating Principal must
satisfy such obligations until you designate a new Certified Manager of the Franchised Business, who is acceptable to us and has successfully
completed the initial training program we require.

decor as we may reasonably direct.
6.17 Ongoing Upgrades and Refurbishments. Throughout the term of this Agreement, you must maintain all of the fixtures, furnishings,
equipment, decor, and signs that we prescribe from time to time in the Manuals or otherwise in writing. If we determine that additional or
replacement equipment is needed because of a change in menu items or method of preparation and service, a change in technology, customer
concerns, health or safety considerations, or because of any other reason, you agree that you will install the additional equipment or replacement
equipment within the reasonable time we specify.
6.18 Five-Year Refurbishment and Renovations. At our request, but not more often than once every five (5) years (and not before the fifth
year after you begin operating), unless sooner required by your lease, you must refurbish the Premises, at your expense, to conform to the
restaurant design, façade, signage, trade dress, color schemes, and presentation of the Proprietary Marks in a manner consistent with the then-
current image for new Pizza Fusion restaurants. Such refurbishment may include structural changes, installation of new equipment and signs,
remodeling, redecoration, and modifications to existing improvements, and, shall be completed pursuant to such standards, specifications, and
deadlines as we may reasonably specify.
6.19. Insurance.
6.19.1. Types and Amounts of Coverage . Throughout the entire Term, you must maintain such types of insurance, in such
amounts, as we may require. Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or
otherwise. Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us with an A.M. Best rating of “A” or
better, and, must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following:

employer’s liability insurance, as well as such other insurance as may be required by statute or rule of the state in which the Franchised Business is
located;
(c) fire, lightning, vandalism, theft, malicious mischief, flood (if in a special flood-hazard area), sprinkler damage, and the
perils described in ex-tended-coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full-replacement value of the supplies, furniture,
fixtures, equipment, machinery, inventory, and plate glass having a deductible of not more than $1,000 and naming us as a loss payee;
(d) automobile liability insurance-including coverage of vehicles not owned by you, but used by employees in
connection with the Franchised Business, with a combination of primary and excess limits of not less than $1,000,000;
(e) commercial blanket bond in the amount of $100,000; and
(f) such other insurance, in such amounts, as we reasonably require for our and your protection.
At any time, we may adjust the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional
kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance.
6.19.2. Evidence of Insurance . By the dates specified below, an approved insurance company must issue a certificate of
insurance showing compliance with the insurance requirements in this Section 6.19  [Insurance] and you must furnish us with a paid receipt

or leased by you, 10 days from the Agreement Date; or (c) if the Premises are not presently owned or leased, 10 days after ownership of the
Premises is conveyed to you or you sign a lease for the Premises. The certificate of insurance must include a statement by the insurer that the
policy or policies may not be canceled, subject to nonrenewal, or materially altered without at least 30 days’ prior written notice to us. Upon our
request, you must supply us with copies of all insurance policies and proof of payment. Every year, you must send us current certificates of
insurance and copies of all insurance policies.

remodeling of the Premises, you must cause the general contractor to maintain commercial general liability insurance (with comprehensive
automobile liability coverage for both owned and non-owned vehicles, builder’s risk, product liability, and independent contractors coverage) with
a reputable insurer. Such insurance must be in the amount of at least $1,000,000 and must name us and you as an additional named insured party, as
our respective interests may appear. You must also cause the general contractor to maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability
insurance as may be required by law.
6.19.4. Our Right to Participate in Claims Procedure . We, or our insurer, may participate in discussions with your insurance
company or any claimant (in conjunction with your insurance company) regarding any claim.
6.19.5. Waiver of Subrogation . To the extent this Section may be effective without invalidating, or making it impossible to secure,
insurance coverage from responsible insurance companies that are doing business in your state (even though an extra premium may result), with
respect to any loss covered by insurance we and you then carry, neither party’s insurance companies have any right of subrogation against those
of the other.
Page 16 of 39
Source: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/20156.19.6. Effect of Our Insurance . Any insurance that we maintain does not in any way limit or affect your obligation to obtain and
maintain the foregoing policy or policies in the amounts specified in this Section. Our performance of your obligations will relieve you of liability
under the indemnity provisions set forth in this Agreement.
6.19.7. Your Failure to Maintain Insurance . If, for any reason, you fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this
Agreement (as we may revise from time to time), we have the right (but not the duty) to procure such insurance. If we do so, we may charge the
cost of such insurance, plus interest at the contract interest rate, to you. Upon demand, you must immediately pay us such charges, together with a
reasonable fee for our expenses in so acting.
6.19.8. Group Insurance . We may make available to you insurance coverage through group or master policies we arrange (such
as relating to property and casualty, workers’ compensation, liability and health, life and disability insurance).
6.20. Vendors. You agree to promptly pay, when due, all trade creditors and vendors (including but not limited to any that are affiliated
with us) that supply goods and/or services to you in connection with operating your Franchised Business.
6.21. General Advice. We will make available to you information about new developments, techniques, and improvements in the areas of
operations, management, and marketing, to the same extent as we make the information available to other Restaurant franchisees in good standing.

seminars, individual or group counseling, training programs, telephone communications, or other forms of communications.
6.22 Special Assistance . If you request, and we can reasonably accommodate such request, we will furnish non-routine guidance and
assistance to deal with your unusual or unique operating problems at reasonable per diem fees and charges that we periodically establish, as well
as our out-of-pocket expenses.
6.23 Credit Cards and Other Methods of Payment. At all times, you must maintain credit-card relationships with the credit- and debit-card
issuers or sponsors, check or credit verification services, financial-center services, and electronic-fund-transfer systems that we designate as
mandatory, and you must not use any such services or providers that we have not approved in writing or for which we have revoked our approval.
We have the right to modify our requirements and designate additional approved or required methods of payment and vendors for processing such
payments, and to revoke our approval of any service provider. You must comply with all our credit-card policies, including minimum purchase
requirements for a customer’s use of a credit card as prescribed in the Manual.
6.24 Conferences . We may conduct annual conferences or conventions, which may include training sessions. We may require your
Operating Principal, Certified Managers, and other designated employees to attend the conferences. You will be solely responsible for all costs
incurred by you and your employees in attending any conferences or conventions.
6.25 Pricing. We may, from time to time, but only to the extent permitted by law, establish and impose maximum and minimum prices for the
goods and services that you are permitted to sell or offer to sell. If we do so, you must not set your prices below the minimum level that we have
established, and not above the maximum level that we have established.
6.26 Certification of Performance. After we perform our preopening obligations under this Agreement, we may request that you execute a
certification (the “Certification of Performance”), in a form we reasonably request, confirming such performance. If we make this request, you must
execute and deliver the Certification of Performance to us within three-business days of our request. If, however, you do not reasonably believe
that we have performed all our preopening obligations under this Agreement, you must, within said three-day period, provide us with written notice
specifically describing the obligations that we have not performed. Not later than three-business days after we complete all the obligations
specifically described in your notice, you must execute and deliver the Certification of Performance to us. You must do so even if we performed
such obligations after the time performance was due under this Agreement. The term “preopening obligations” means such of our obligations to
you under this Agreement that must be performed before the Opening Date for the Franchised Business.

material breach of this Agreement, for which we may terminate this Agreement without opportunity to cure. Our consent to a Transfer does not
constitute a waiver of any claims that we have against the transferor, nor is it a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this
Agreement.
14.8. Our Right of First Refusal. We have the right, exercisable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice specified in Section 14.2
[No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] , to send written notice to you that we intend to purchase the interest proposed to be
Transferred. We may assign our right of first refusal to someone else either before or after we exercise it. However, our right of first refusal will not
apply with regard to a Transfer under Section 14.5  [Transfer to a Corporation or Other Entity]  or a Transfer to your parents, spouse, son,
daughter, or mother or father in-law (including Transfers to your parents, spouse, son, daughter, or mother or father in-law as a result of death or
incapacity as described in Section 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity] ).

Transferred on the same economic terms and conditions offered by the third-party. Closing on our purchase must occur by the later of (a) 60 days
after the date of our notice to the seller electing to purchase the interest, or (b) the closing date as proposed in the third-party’s purchase offer. If
we cannot reasonably be expected to furnish the same consideration as the third-party, then we may substitute the reasonable equivalent in cash. If
the parties cannot agree within 30 days on the reasonable equivalent in cash, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser and the
appraiser’s determination will be final. Any material change in the terms of the offer from a third-party after we have elected not to purchase the
seller’s interest will constitute a new offer subject to the same right of first refusal as the third party’s initial offer.
14.8.2. If a Transfer is proposed to be made by gift, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser to determine the
fair market value of the interest proposed to be transferred. We may purchase the interest at the fair market value determined by the appraiser.
Closing on the purchase will occur within 30 days after our notice to the transferor of the appraiser’s determination of fair market value.

Sections 14.2  [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] through  14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity]  above. Closing of the Transfer
must occur within 60 calendar days of our election (or such longer period as applicable law may require); otherwise, the third-party’s offer will be
treated as a new offer subject to our right of first refusal. The Transfer is conditional upon our determination that the Transfer was on terms
substantially the same as those offered to us.

You also agree to immediately deliver to us the Manual and all training materials, marketing materials, records, files, forms, instructions, signs,
equipment, correspondence, copies, Customer Data, and other property in your possession or control that contain confidential information (as
defined in Section 12) or that bear the Proprietary Marks and you agree not to retain any unauthorized copies of these materials. You also must
deliver to us all customer information that you have compiled.
16.1.3. You agree to immediately cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner, the name “Pizza Fusion,” all other
Proprietary Marks, and all other distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, Websites, domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other
identifier (whether or not we have authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business or that are
otherwise associated with the Proprietary Marks, System, and/or us. If you subsequently begin to operate another business, you agree that you
will not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Proprietary Marks that you used either in connection with the
Franchised Business or its promotion, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or which is likely to dilute our exclusive rights in
and to the Proprietary Marks, nor any trade dress or designation of origin or description or representation which falsely suggests or represents an
association or connection with us.
16.1.4. You agree to promptly take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent
registration containing the name PIZZA FUSION  or any other Proprietary Marks.
16.1.5 You will, at our option, assign to us any interest which you have in the lease or sublease for the Premises.
(a) If we do not elect or are unable to exercise our option to acquire, or to acquire the lease or sublease for the Premises,
you must make such modifications or alterations to the premises operated hereunder (including, without limitation, the changing of the telephone
number) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to distinguish the appearance of the Premises from that
of other Restaurants under the System, and such specific additional changes as we may reasonably request for that purpose. In addition, you must
stop making any use of any telephone number and/or any domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other identifier (whether or not we have
authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business, and you must promptly execute such documents
or take such steps necessary to remove reference to the Franchised Business from all trade or business telephone directories, including physical
and online “yellow” and “white” pages, or at our request transfer same to us.
(b) If you fail or refuse to comply with the requirements of this Section 16.1.5  [OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION
OR EXPIRATION], we will have the right to enter upon the Premises, without being guilty of trespass or any other tort, for the purpose of making
or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at your expense, which you agree to pay upon demand.
16.2. Purchase of Assets. You agree that, at our option, you will sell to us any or all your assets used to operate the Franchised Business
(including equipment, fixtures, furnishings, Delivery Vehicles, supplies, and inventory) that we ask in writing to purchase.
16.2.1. The purchase price for such items will be equal to your depreciated cost (determined below) or fair market value,
whichever is less. The cost will be determined based upon a five (5) year straight-line depreciation of original costs. For equipment that is five (5) or
more years old, the parties agree that fair market value will be deemed to be ten percent (10%) of the equipment’s original cost. The fair market value
of tangible assets must be determined without reference to good will, going-concern value, or other intangible assets.
Page 32 of 39
Source: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/201516.2.2. We may exercise this option by delivering a notice of intent to purchase to you within 30 days after the expiration or
termination of this Agreement. During that 30-day period, you agree not to dispose of, transfer, or otherwise hinder our ability to exercise our rights
with respect to your assets.
16.2.3. If we exercise our option to purchase, we may setoff all amounts due to us under this Agreement and the cost of the
appraisal (if any), against any payment due to you.
16.2.4. If we do not exercise our rights to purchase your Delivery Vehicle(s), you must immediately make such modifications or
alterations to the Delivery Vehicle(s) that may be needed to remove any Proprietary Marks and to otherwise distinguish the appearance of the
vehicle(s) from those used by other Restaurants.
16.3. Right to Enter and Continue Operations. In order to preserve the goodwill of the System following termination, we (or our
designee) have the right to enter the Premises (without liability to you, your Owners, or otherwise) for the purpose continuing the Franchised
Business’ operation and maintaining the goodwill of the business.
16.4. Liquidated Damages. If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum
payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average  of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before
our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the
lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement.
16.5. Liquidated Damages.
16.5.1 The payments called for in Section 16.4  [Liquidated Damages]  above constitute liquidated damages for causing the
premature termination of this Agreement and not a penalty. A precise calculation of the full extent of damages that we will incur if this Agreement
terminates because you default cannot be reasonably determined. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under
Section 16.4  [Liquidated Damages]  above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to
occur in such event.
16.5.2 The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4  [Liquidated Damages]  above is not a penalty and is intended by the
parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Neither does the sum
contemplated in Section 16.4  [Liquidated Damages]  above represent a price for the privilege of not performing or its payment represent an
alternative manner of performance. Accordingly, as a purely liquidated damage provision, this Section does not preclude, nor is inconsistent with, a
court granting us specific performance or any other equitable remedies, such as an injunction, to prevent future breaches. Our rights to liquidated
damages and specific performance or any other equitable relief are not mutually exclusive.
16.6. Enforcement Costs. You agree to pay all damages, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees,
that we incur (even if after the expiration or termination of this Agreement) in enforcing this Section 16 or Section 17.2  [After Termination,
Expiration, or Transfer]  below.
17. RESTRICTIONS ON COMPETITION
17.1. During Term. You acknowledge that this Agreement will give you access to valuable and confidential information regarding the
System, including our business development strategy and the operational, sales, promotional and marketing methods of Franchised Businesses.
You agree that during the term of this Agreement, you will not, without our prior written consent, either directly or indirectly through any other
person or entity:

any business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food
specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Restaurants (“ Competitive Business”);
17.1.2. Divert or attempt to divert any business or customer, or potential business or customer, to any Competitive Business; or
17.1.3. Induce any person to leave his or her employment with us.

any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within three (3) mile radius of the Premises of your Franchised
Business or within a three (3) mile radius of any Restaurant then-operating or under construction to operate under the System, except as permitted
by any Franchise Agreements that remain in effect between you and us. .
17.3. Owners and Employees. The Owners agree that they will personally bind themselves to this Section 17 by signing this Agreement or
the attached Guaranty. With respect to the Owners, the time period in Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer]  will run from the
expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement or from the termination of the Owner’s relationship with you, whichever occurs first. You must
also require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in Section 12 above, and this Section 17 (as modified to apply to an
individual), from any or all of the following persons: your officers, directors, and their respective spouses and employees. (These persons and the
Owners are each a “ Restricted Party ”) The covenants required by this Section 17.3  [Owners and Employees]  shall be in the form provided in
Appendix C to this Agreement. Failure by Franchisee to obtain execution of a covenant required by this Section 17.3  [Owners and Employees]
shall constitute a default under Section 15.2.13  [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] above.
17.4. Indirect Violations Prohibited. You may not attempt to circumvent the restrictions in Sections 17.1  [During Term] and  17.2  [After
Termination, Expiration, or Transfer]  by engaging in prohibited activity indirectly through any other person or entity.
17.5. Enforcement. You agree that the existence of any claim you may have against us, whether or not arising from this Agreement, will
not constitute a defense to our enforcement of this Section 17. You agree to pay all costs and expenses that we reasonably incur in enforcing this
Section 17, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. You acknowledge that a violation of the terms of this Section 17 would result in irreparable injury
to us for which no adequate remedy at law may be available. Accordingly, you consent to the issuance of an injunction prohibiting any conduct in
violation of the terms of this Section 17. Such injunctive relief will be in addition to any other remedies that we may have.
18. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES
This Agreement does not create a fiduciary or other special relationship or make you or us an agent, legal representative, joint venturer,
partner, employee, or servant of each other for any purpose. You are not authorized to, and agree that you will not, make any contract, agreement,
warranty, or representation on our behalf, or create any obligation, express or implied, on our behalf. During the term of this Agreement, you agree
to hold yourself out to the public as an independent contractor operating the Franchised Business under license from us, and you agree to disclose
your status as independent contractor in all business dealings and exhibit a notice to that effect (the location and content of which we reserve the
right to specify) on all promotional materials, invoices and stationery.

of investigation, settlement costs, and interest), liabilities and damages (collectively, “ Claims”) arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in
connection with your activities under this Agreement. With respect to any threatened or actual litigation, proceeding, or dispute that could directly
or indirectly affect us or any of the other indemnitees under this Section, if you do not assume the active defense of the matter within a reasonable
time, we will have the right, but not the obligation, to: (i) choose counsel; (ii) direct and control the handling of the matter; and (iii) settle any claim

20.2. Waivers. No delay or failure to exercise any right under this Agreement or to insist upon your strict compliance with any obligation
or condition, and no custom or practice that differs from the terms of this Agreement, will constitute a waiver of our right to exercise the contract
provision or to demand your strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Our waiver of any particular default does not affect or impair our
rights with respect to any subsequent default you may commit. Our waiver of a default by another franchisee does not affect or impair our right to
demand your strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Our acceptance of any payments due from you does not waive any prior defaults.
21. NOTICES

sender evidence of delivery, or of rejected delivery, to the respective parties. Any notice by a means that affords the sender evidence of delivery, or

23.1. Clauses are Severable.  Each provision of this Agreement is severable from the others. If, for any reason, any provision is
determined by a court to be invalid, the invalidity will not impair the operation of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The latter will
continue to be given full force and effect and bind us and you.
23.2. Survival of Clauses. Each provision of this Agreement that expressly or by reasonable implication is to be performed, in whole or in
part, after the expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement will survive such expiration, termination, or Transfer.
23.3 Force Majeure. If the performance of any obligation by any party under this Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason
of Force Majeure, which cannot be overcome by reasonable commercial measures, then the parties shall be relieved of their respective obligations
(but only to the extent, that the parties, having exercised best efforts, are prevented, hindered or delayed in such performance) during the period of
such Force Majeure. The party whose performance is affected by an event of Force Majeure shall give prompt written notice in the circumstances
of such Force Majeure event to the other party by describing the nature of the event and an estimate as to its duration, if possible. As used in this
Agreement, the term “ Force Majeure” means any act of God, strike, lock out or other industrial disturbance, terrorist act, war (declared or
undeclared), riot, epidemic, fire or other catastrophe, or act of any government. However, your inability to obtain financing or make payments
(regardless of the reason) does not constitute “Force Majeure.”

information on the cover page and in the recital paragraphs. The parties also agree that all of the captions in this Agreement are meant only for the
convenience of the parties, and none of the captions shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.
23.5 No Third Party Rights. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended (nor shall be deemed) to
confer upon any party any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except for you, us, and such of our respective successors and
assigns as may be contemplated (and, as to you, permitted) by Sections 13 and 14 above.
24. GOVERNING LAW
This Agreement and the relationship between the parties is governed by and will be construed exclusively in accordance with the laws of
the State of Florida (without regard to, and without applying, Florida conflict-of-law rules).
25. DISPUTES
25.1. Submission to Mediation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7 [Remedies Not Exclusive]  below, any controversy or claim
arising between us will first be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by an established, neutral mediation service with experience in
franchise disputes. Both parties must sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take
place in the city where our principal offices are located at the time the demand for mediation is filed. Once either party has submitted a dispute to
mediation, the obligation to attend will be binding on both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the
mediation, however, will be split equally.
25.2. Forum for Litigation. You and the Owners must file any suit against us, and we may file any suit against you, in the federal or state
court where our principal office is located at the time the suit is filed. The parties waive all questions of personal jurisdiction and venue for the
purpose of carrying out this provision.

irrevocably barred.
25.7. Remedies Not Exclusive . Except as provided in Sections 25.1  [Submission to Mediation]  through  25.4  [Mutual Waiver of Jury
Trial] above, no right or remedy that the parties have under this Agreement is exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or
under applicable law.
25.8. Our Right to Injunctive Relief. Nothing in this Agreement bars our right to obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement that will cause us loss or damage. You agree that we will not be required to prove actual damages or post a
bond or other security in seeking or obtaining injunctive relief (both preliminary and permanent) and/or specific performance.

inconsistency,  this Agreement  prevails over the MOD Manual.  References to the

to it hereunder,  or to insist upon strict  compliance by the  Franchisee or the

Fees or other  amounts  due  hereunder,  Pretzel  Time  shall be  authorized  to
initiate  immediately a debit to Franchisee's  account in the appropriate amount
in  accordance  with the foregoing  procedure,  plus interest as provided for in
this  Agreement.  Any  overpayment  shall be  credited to  Franchisee's  account
through a credit  effective  as of the first week after  Franchisee  and Pretzel
Time  determine  that such credit is due.  Notwithstanding  any  designation  by
Franchisee, Pretzel Time shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments by
Franchisee to any past  indebtedness  of Franchisee  for Royalty or  Advertising
Fund Fees,  purchases from Pretzel Time and/or its  Affiliates,  interest or any
other indebtedness,  including,  without  limitation,  payment of rental sums in
arrears for the Unit.
         4.I.     LATE CHARGE AND INTEREST.
         To compensate Pretzel Time for the increased  administrative expense of
handling late payments,  Pretzel Time may charge Franchisee a $50.00 late charge
for each delinquent payment.  All Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due
for  purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates,  and other
amounts  which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  shall bear
interest  after  their due date at a rate equal to the  lesser of: (1)  eighteen
percent (18%) per annum for the number of days which such payment is due; or (2)
the highest  applicable  legal rate  permitted  by  applicable  law.  Franchisee
acknowledges  that this  Section  shall  not  constitute  Pretzel  Time's or its
Affiliates' agreement to accept such payments after they are due or a commitment
by Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  to extend  credit to or  otherwise  finance
operation of the Unit.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  4.I.,
Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that his failure to pay all amounts when due
shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.

         to maintain  possession  of the Site, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel
         Time,  the Unit should be  relocated,  Franchisee  secures a substitute

         substitute  site in compliance with  specifications  and standards then

         distinct  from  those  of a  Franchise,  Products  and  services  which

         Following receipt of Franchisee's election to renew, Pretzel Time shall
provide Franchisee with an execution copy of the form of Franchise  Agreement to
be entered into for the renewal  term.  If the  Franchisee  does not execute and
return the renewal Franchise Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt,  then
Franchisee  shall be deemed to have  withdrawn  its notice of renewal,  and this
Agreement shall terminate at the end of the current term.

notice,  elect not to renew the Franchise  Agreement.  Pretzel Time shall notify
Franchisee  of the  nonrenewal  not  less  than  six  (6)  months  prior  to the

successors and assigns. Failure by Franchisee and its Owners to sign and deliver
to Pretzel  Time,  such  agreements  and releases  within thirty (30) days after
delivery  thereof to Franchisee shall be deemed an election by Franchisee not to
obtain a Successor Franchise.
         5.C.     NOTICES.
         Franchisee  shall give Pretzel  Time written  notice of its election to

give Franchisee, written notice, not more than thirty (30) days after receipt of
Franchisee's notice of (a) Pretzel Time's  determination  whether or not it will
grant Franchisee a Successor  Franchise  pursuant to this Section and/or (b) any
deficiencies  in  Franchisee's  operation  of the Unit (or any other  failure to
comply  with the terms of this  Agreement)  which could  cause  Pretzel  Time to
refuse to grant a  Successor  Franchise.  Such notice  shall state what  actions
Franchisee  must take to correct  the  deficiencies  and shall  specify the time
period in which such  deficiencies  must be  corrected.  Pretzel Time shall give

Time  may  extend  the term of this  Agreement  for  such  period  of time as is
necessary in order to provide Franchisee reasonable time to cure deficiencies or
to provide ninety (90) days notice of Pretzel Time's  determination not to grant

         7.A.     SITE SELECTION.
         Franchisee  shall be  responsible  for leasing a suitable  site for the
Franchise  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval.  Pretzel  Time agrees to assist
Franchisee  in locating and securing a location for the unit which is acceptable

list of desired locations on the Location Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit W
or if Pretzel  Time  directs on a form  prepared  by Pretzel  Time and  attached

shall be terminated and all franchise fees paid by Franchisee shall be refunded.
         Pretzel  Time  shall  approve  the site for the unit in  reliance  upon
information furnished and representations made by Franchisee with respect to the
size, appearance, and other physical characteristics of the site, photographs of
the site, demographic characteristics,  traffic patterns, competition from other
businesses in the area,  and other  commercial  characteristics.  Pretzel Time's
approval of the site  indicates  only that Pretzel Time  believes  that the site
falls  within  acceptable  criteria  established  by Pretzel Time as of the time
period  encompassing the evaluation.  Franchisee  agrees that Pretzel Time shall
not be responsible for the failure of a franchise, site and/or premises approved
by Pretzel  Time to meet  expectations  as to potential  revenue or  operational
criteria.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that his acceptance of a Franchise
for the  operation of a Unit in the  Territory  is based on his own  independent
investigation of the suitability of the mall location.
         Franchisee  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time's  approval of the lease or
sublease  for the Unit does not  constitute  a guarantee  or warranty by Pretzel
Time, express or implied, of the successful operation or profitability of a Unit
operated at the designated Site. Such approval  indicates only that Pretzel Time
believes  that the Unit and the terms of the lease fall  within  the  acceptable
criteria  established  by Pretzel  Time as of the time period  encompassing  the
evaluation.
         7.B.     LEASE.

Franchisee.  Franchisee  agrees to  execute  a letter  of  intent  for the lease
premises  which  outlines the basic economic terms of the lease and return it to
Pretzel  Time within five (5) days of receipt of same.  Franchisee  acknowledges
and agrees that he is  responsible  for reviewing the terms of the agreement and

Time and at Pretzel Time's option shall contain such provisions,  including, but
not limited, to:

               costs and payments incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting the cure
               shall be immediately due and owing to Pretzel Time by Franchisee;

               sublease  to Pretzel  Time  without the  lessor's or  sublessor's
               consent;
          (3). Allowing  Franchisee  to  transfer  the lease to Pretzel  Time or
               another  approved  franchisee in the event that Franchisee  sells

               Assignee) shall have the right (but not the obligation) to assume
               the lease or sublease:
                  (i) Upon termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time or upon
                  expiration of this Agreement (unless a Successor  Franchise isgranted to Franchisee), or
                  (ii) If  Franchisee  fails to exercise any options to renew or
                  extend the lease or sublease or,
                  (iii) If Franchisee commits a default that gives the lessor or
                  sublessor the right to terminate the lease or sublease, or
                  (iv)  If  Pretzel  Time  or  one  of  its  Affiliates  or  its
                  designee/assignee purchases the Unit.
          (6). A provision allowing sampling in front of the retail Unit;
          (7). A provision  that the premises are to be used  exclusively  for a
               Pretzel Time Unit only; and
          (8). A provision which permits alterations to the premises in a good
         and workman-like manner by Franchisee as required by Pretzel Time.
         Franchisee further agrees to execute and return the lease and any other
riders,  guaranties or sureties  required by the Landlord  within seven (7) days
from receipt of the same and no later than sixty (60) days after signing of this
Agreement.  If any lease  expires  prior to the  expiration  of this  Agreement,
Franchisee  will be  required to arrange  any  necessary  lease for the Unit and
Pretzel Time shall have the right to approve the terms of the renewal  lease for
the Unit prior to Franchisee's execution thereof. Franchisee agrees that he will
not execute a lease or sublease which Pretzel Time has  disapproved.  Franchisee
shall  deliver a copy of the signed  lease to Pretzel  Time for the Unit  within
five (5) business days after its full execution.  The copy shall be complete and
include copies of all signature pages and exhibits.
         A copy of the form of the sublease  that  Franchisee  shall execute (if
Pretzel Time is the tenant  pursuant to the lease) is attached hereto as Exhibit
M. A copy of the form of the  collateral  assignement  of lease that  Franchisee
shall execute (if  Franchisee  is the tenant  pursuant to the lease) is attached

lease covering the franchise  location,  including any required security deposit
and  prepaid  rent.  Franchisee  agrees  to pay the Unit  rent  directly  to the
landlord at the rate and terms  specified in the primary lease between  landlord
and Franchisee. Rent is generally paid monthly on the first day of the month and
is  non-refundable.  Franchisee  agrees  that the Unit  shall be used  only as a
Pretzel Time franchise.
         If  Franchisee  fails to obtain  lawful  possession of an approved Site
(through a lease or assignment) within sixty (60) days after delivery of Pretzel
Time's approval of the Site, Pretzel Time, may, in its sole discretion, withdraw
approval of such Site at any time.
         7.C.     RELOCATION.
         In the event that  Franchisee's  lease is  terminated,  with or without
fault of  Franchisee,  if the Site is damaged,  condemned or otherwise  rendered
unusable as a Pretzel Time Unit in accordance with this Agreement, or if, in the
judgment of Pretzel Time and  Franchisee,  there is a change in the character of
the location of the Site sufficiently  detrimental to his business  potential to
warrant its relocation,  Pretzel Time will not unreasonably  withhold permission
for  relocation  of the  Unit  to  another  Site,  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's
then-current  site  criteria,  subject to the rights of  existing  Pretzel  Time
franchisees  under their  franchise  agreements  with Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee
acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time is under no  obligation  to approve a
relocation of the Franchise.  However,  upon written approval from Pretzel Time,
Franchisee may relocate the Franchise to another  location.  Such approval shall
not be granted unless  Franchisee is in compliance with all terms and conditions
of this  Agreement  and  Franchisee  has the  financial  resources  available to
relocate the Unit and construct a new and  comparable  Unit according to Pretzel
Time's then current design  standards.  Any such  relocation of the Franchise is
subject to Pretzel Time's prior  approval of the new Unit  location.  Relocation
shall be at  Franchisee's  sole expense and Pretzel Time shall have the right to
charge  Franchisee  for  any and all  costs  incurred  by  Pretzel  Time,  and a
reasonable  fee  for  its  services,  in  connection  with  any  such  approval,
evaluation  and  relocation  of the  Franchise.  The Unit  shall  re-open at the
replacement  Site as soon as  reasonably  practicable  but in no event more than
ninety (90) days after the closing of the original location.

         Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that, while Pretzel Time's training
program will provide  Franchisee  with the  fundamental  knowledge  necessary to
operate a unit,  Franchisee  cannot  expect  success  unless he devotes his best
personal efforts to the business and exercises good business judgment in dealing
with customers,  suppliers, and employees.  Prior to the Unit's opening, Pretzel
Time shall  furnish an initial  training  program on the  operation of a Pretzel
Time Unit which shall take place at Pretzel Time's  headquarters  in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania,  or at a location  which will  provide the best  training  for theFranchisee,  which may or may not be close to Pretzel Time's  headquarters.  The

date. Pretzel Time will not charge for the initial training of the Franchisee or
if a corporation or partnership,  the Principal Owners of the Franchisee and the
Unit  Manager.  All  incidental  expenses  relative  to the  required  training,
including  travel  expenses,  hotel/motel  expenses,  and  meals  shall  be  the
responsibility  of  the  Franchisee  while  attending  training.  Prior  to  the

the Franchisee as identified in Exhibit B, who will be personally overseeing the

program to the satisfaction of Pretzel Time.
         The  Franchisee  and his  Unit  Manager  must  satisfactorily  complete
Pretzel  Time's  training as  determined  by Pretzel  Time, in its sole opinion,
before  Franchisee is allowed to operate the Franchise.  If Pretzel Time, in its
sole discretion, determines that Franchisee is unable to satisfactorily complete
the  training  program,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right to  terminate  this
Agreement and no franchise fees shall be refunded.  The initial training program
shall cover material aspects of the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit,  including
financial   controls,   employee  relations,   food  preparation,   service  and
operational techniques,  sampling, recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and
public  relations,  cleanliness and maintenance  procedures,  and maintenance of
Pretzel  Time  System  standards.  Franchisee  shall  receive  one  copy  of the
Operations Manual, which cannot be reproduced, in whole or in part. In the event
that  the  Franchisee's  copy  is  lost  destroyed  or  significantly   damaged,
Franchisee  shall be  obligated  to obtain from Pretzel  Time,  at  Franchisee's
expense a replacement copy of the Operations Manual.
         10.B.    EMPLOYEE TRAINING.

guidance in the selection of a Unit Manager and may provide periodic evaluations
of  Franchisee's  Unit,  Managers  and  employees,  but  without  any  liability
therefore to Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall hire all employees of the franchise,
be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their employment and  compensation,
and  implement a training  program for  employees of the  franchise.  Franchisee
agrees  to  maintain  a staff  of  trained  employees  to  operate  the  Unit in
compliance with Pretzel Time's standards.
         In the event the Unit Manager ceases to hold such full-time position at
the  Unit,  Franchisee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days in  which to  appoint  a
substitute  or  replacement  Unit  Manager,  who must  attend  and  successfully
complete,  to  Pretzel  Time's  satisfaction  the  initial  training  program as
specified  above within sixty (60) days after  employment  as Unit  Manager.  If
Pretzel  Time in its sole  discretion  determines  that the Unit  Manager or any
subsequently  appointed Unit Manager has failed to  satisfactorily  complete the
initial  training  program or any  additional  or  refresher  training  program,
Franchisee  agrees to  immediately  hire a substitute  Unit Manager and promptly
arrange  for such  person  to  complete  the  initial  training  program  to the
satisfaction  of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to notify Pretzel Time of any

Time,  in writing,  of his opening  date  twenty (20) days prior  thereto.  This
training  will include all  functions  required for the proper  operation of the
franchise.

order to facilitate  the opening of the  Franchise,  and should Pretzel Time, in
its discretion,  deem it necessary,  feasible and appropriate to comply with the
request or should Pretzel Time determine that  additional  training is required,
Franchisee  shall  reimburse  Pretzel Time at Pretzel  Time's then current daily
training  service fee, for the expense of Pretzel Time providing such additional
assistance and for its training  related  expenses,  which may include,  travel,

Pretzel Time's choice from time to time for  experienced  franchisees  and their

courses  for  previously  trained  and  experienced  managers.  Fees for special
programs will be based upon Pretzel Time's actual costs and attendance  shall be
required. Attendance at retraining programs or seminars shall be at Franchisee's
sole expense,  provided,  however,  that attendance will not be required at more
than two (2) such  programs  in any  calendar  year and shall  not  collectively
exceed ten (10) business days in duration during any calendar year.
         10.F.    OTHER GUIDANCE.
         Pretzel  Time may  advise  Franchisee  from  time to time of  operating

amount greater or less than the aggregate  contributions  of the  franchisees to
the fund in that  year and  Pretzel  Time  may  make  loans to the fund  bearing
reasonable  interest  to cover  any  deficits  of the fund and cause the fund to
invest any surplus for future use by the fund. It is anticipated,  and it is the

following year.

is  required  pursuant  to the terms and  conditions  of  Franchisee's  lease or
sublease.  Franchisee  acknowledges  such amounts will vary from lease to lease,

Agreement and are  incorporated  herein by  reference.  Such  Operations  Manual
provisions and all reasonable  modifications shall be binding upon Franchisee to
the same extent as if set forth verbatim in this Franchise  Agreement,  and such

investment cannot in Pretzel Time's reasonable  judgment be amortized during the
remaining term of this  Agreement.  Franchisee  hereby agrees that standards and

otherwise  communicated  to  Franchisee  in  writing  or  electronically,  shall

expenses to operate the Unit, including, without limitation, the purchase and/or

appealing  manner.  Pretzel  Time has  developed  and shall  continue to develop
certain  proprietary food products which will be prepared by or for Pretzel Time

shall continue to develop  standards and  specifications  for fresh  hand-rolled

prices,  output requirements,  distribution methods and locations,  standards of
service, financial capability,  customer service and other criteria.  Franchisee

after receipt in writing of any modification of an approved or required supplier
or distributor,  manufacturer  of equipment,  products,  materials,  supplies or
other items  reorder any product  from any  supplier or  distributor  that is no
longer  approved.  Pretzel Time may approve or require a single  distributor  or
supplier  for any  Products,  materials or supplies and may approve or require a
distributor or supplier only as to certain products, materials and supplies, and
such approval may be temporary pending a further  evaluation of such distributor
or supplier by Pretzel Time. Pretzel Time may concentrate  purchases with one or
more distributors or suppliers to obtain lower prices and/or advertising support
and/or  services for the benefit of Pretzel Time, the Pretzel Time System and/or
Pretzel Time Units.
         Pretzel Time will loan to Franchisee a list of approved  brand Products
for use during the term of this  Franchise  Agreement  at the  initial  training
session.  Franchisee  agrees to not copy the list.  Franchisee will,  during the
term of this Agreement and after its  termination  or  expiration,  maintain the
list  and its  contents  in  strict  confidence,  and  upon  the  expiration  or
termination of this Franchise Agreement,  whichever is earlier, will immediately
return it to Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall promptly provide  Franchisee with
any  amendments to the  designated  list of inventory of available  Products and
supplies to be carried and sold at Franchisee's  location.  Franchisee  shall at
all times  maintain an adequate  inventory of approved  Products  sufficient  in
quality and variety to realize the full potential of the Unit.

shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice
Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty
(30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.
         The insurance afforded by the policy or policies  respecting  liability
shall  not be  limited  in any  way by  reason  of any  insurance  which  may be
maintained  by  Pretzel  Time.  Within  sixty  (60) days of the  signing of this
Agreement,  but in no event later than the date on which Franchisee  acquires an
interest in the real  property  (by lease or  purchase) on which it will develop
and operate the Franchise,  a Certificate of Insurance  showing  compliance with
the foregoing  requirements shall be furnished by Franchisee to Pretzel Time for
approval.  Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be
canceled or altered  without at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to
Pretzel Time and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such
insurance  and the  performance  by  Franchisee  of the  obligations  under this
Section shall not relieve Franchisee of liability under the indemnity  provision
set forth in this  Agreement.  Minimum  limits as required above may be modified
from time to time, as conditions require by written notice to Franchisee.
         Should  Franchisee not procure and maintain such insurance  coverage as
required  by Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right and  authority,
without any obligation to do so, immediately procure such insurance coverage and
to charge same to Franchisee,  which charges  together with a reasonable fee for
expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in connection with such procurement,  shall be
payable by Franchisee immediately upon notice.
         Franchisee  shall fully  cooperate  with Pretzel Time in its efforts to
obtain  such  insurance  policies,  promptly  execute  all forms or  instruments
required to obtain or maintain such insurance policies, allow inspections of the
Unit or vehicles  which are  required to obtain and maintain  insurance  and pay
Pretzel Time on demand for any costs or premiums.
         14.J.    SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES.
         Pretzel  Time  may  from  time to time  advise  or  offer  guidance  to
Franchisee  relative to prices for Products  offered for sale by Franchisee that
in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice.  Franchisee shall
not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole
right  to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.Whenever Pretzel Time recommends a retail price, such  recommendations are based
on Pretzel  Time's  experience  concerning  all factors that enter into a proper
price, but such recommendation is in no manner binding on Franchisee and no such
advice or guidance  shall be deemed or construed to impose upon  Franchisee  any
obligation  to charge any  fixed,  minimum  or  maximum  prices for any  product
offered for sale by the Franchise.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to advertise
retail  prices of Pretzel Time  Products,  provided  that such retail prices are
qualified as "suggested." The parties understand and agree that such advertising
shall not be  construed  as  requiring  Franchisee  to adhere to such prices but
Franchisee shall have complete freedom to establish retail prices.

         15.A.  ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

related  entities  by Pretzel  Time,  anywhere,  at any time,  without  specific

customer  records,  cash  register  tapes,  sales and  purchase  records and tax
records,  to enable Pretzel Time or its representative or designee to adequately
audit Franchisee's  gross sales.  Franchisee hereby waives any right to withhold

within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of the  inspection or audit report,  the
royalty of seven percent (7%) and the  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent (1%)

described above,  Franchisee will bear the cost of the audit,  including without
limitation,  the charges of attorneys  and any  independent  accountants,  their
travel   expenses,   room  and  board,   and   compensation  of  Pretzel  Time's
representatives  and  independent  accountants.  Providing  that in no case will
Franchisee be obligated to pay more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for such
inspection  or audit  costs.  The  foregoing  remedies  shall be in  addition to

granted the Franchise to Franchisee in reliance upon Pretzel Time's  perceptions
of the individual or collective character,  skill, aptitude,  attitude, business
ability and  financial  capacity of  Franchisee  (or its  Owners).  Accordingly,
Franchisee agrees no Transfer shall be made without Pretzel Time's prior written
approval.  Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this
Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.  Pretzel  Time's  consent to the
assignment  shall  neither  constitute  a  novation  or change  in  Franchisee's
obligations under this agreement,  nor constitute a waiver of any claims Pretzel
Time may have  against  Franchisee  (or its  Owners)  nor be  deemed a waiver of
Pretzel Time's right to demand the transferee's exact compliance with all of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement.
         17.C.  CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF TRANSFER.

         operation of the Unit; provided,  however, that Pretzel Time's approval
         of such Transfer does not ensure the transferee's  success as a Pretzel
         Time Unit  franchisee,  nor should  the  transferee  rely upon  Pretzel
         Time's  approval  of such  Transfer in  determining  whether to acquire
         Franchisee's  Pretzel Time Unit; (8) If Franchisee  (and/or its Owners)

Franchisee  or the Unit,  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall obtain a bona fide,
executed  written offer and earnest  money deposit from a responsible  and fully
disclosed purchaser (including lists of the Owners of record and beneficially of
any corporate  offeror and all general and limited  partners of any  partnership
offeror and, in the case of a publicly-held  corporation or limited partnership,
copies of the most current annual and quarterly  reports) and shall  immediately
submit to Pretzel  Time a true and  complete  copy of such  offer,  which  shall
include  details of the payment  terms of the proposed  sale and the sources and
terms of any financing for the proposed purchase price. To be a valid, bona fide
offer, the proposed purchase price shall be denominated in a dollar amount.  The
offer must apply only to an interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee or the Unit

property  or  rights  from   Franchisee   (or  its  Owners)  under  a  separate,
contemporaneous offer, the price and terms of purchase offered to Franchisee (or
its Owners) for the  interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee  or the Unit shall
reflect the bona fide price  offered  therefore  and shall not reflect any value
for any other property or rights.Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right,  exercisable  by written  notice
delivered to Franchisee  (or its Owners) within sixty (60) days from the date of
delivery  of an exact copy of such  offer to  Pretzel  Time,  to  purchase  such
interest for the price and on the terms and conditions  contained in such offer,
provided that Pretzel Time may substitute cash for any form of payment  proposed
in such offer,  Pretzel Time's credit shall be deemed equal to the credit of any
proposed  purchaser and Pretzel Time shall have not less than sixty (60) days to
prepare  for  closing.  Without  regard to the  representations  and  warranties
demanded by the proposed  purchaser,  if any,  Pretzel Time shall be entitled to
purchase such interest subject to all customary  representations  and warranties
given by the  Franchisee,  seller of the assets of a business or voting stock of
an  incorporated  business,  as  applicable,   including,   without  limitation,
representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition and title to stock,
and /or assets,  liens and  encumbrances  relating to the stock  and/or  assets,
validity  of  contracts  and  liabilities  of the  corporation  whose  stock  is
purchased and affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.
         If Pretzel Time exercises its right of first refusal,  Franchisee  (and
its Owners)  agrees that,  for a period of twelve (12) months  commencing on the
date of the closing,  neither  Franchisee (nor its Owners) shall have any direct
or indirect interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee
or its Owners of  otherwise)  as a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor,
partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, or agent or in
any other capacity in any Competitive Business located or operating within three

shares of that class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.  If Pretzel  Time
exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee (and its Owners) further agrees
that he will abide by the restrictions of Section 17.C.(13).
          If  Pretzel  Time  does not  exercise  its  right  of  first  refusal,
Franchisee or its Owners may complete the sale to such purchaser pursuant to and
on the exact  terms of such  offer,  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval of the
Transfer as provided in Section 17,  provided that if the sale to such purchaser
is not completed  within 120 days after  delivery of such offer to Pretzel Time,
or if there is a  material  change  in the terms of the sale  (which  Franchisee
shall  promptly  communicate  to Pretzel  Time),  Pretzel  Time's right to first
refusal shall be extended for thirty (30) days after the  expiration of such 120
day period or after the material change in the terms of the sale so communicated
to Pretzel Time.

thereof is delivered to Pretzel Time or (2) if such breach cannot  reasonably be
cured  within  thirty (30) days after  Pretzel  Time's  receipt of such  notice,

Agreement  by  Franchisee  for any reason other than a  substantial  breach of a

thirty (30) day period and shall proceed with such cure with due diligence  with

any of them,  of any nature,  even though such  failures may be cured within the
applicable  grace  periods,  Pretzel Time shall have the right by written notice
given to Franchisee  immediately  to declare this  Agreement  terminated,  which

                  to eminent  domain,  destruction of premises or termination of
                  lease without  Franchisee's  fault shall  constitute an act of
                  Default with no right to cure and immediate  termination  upon
                  notice; or

20. RIGHTS AND  OBLIGATIONS OF PRETZEL TIME AND FRANCHISEE  UPON  TERMINATION OR
EXPIRATION OF THE FRANCHISE.
         20.A.  AMOUNTS OWED.
         Unless otherwise authorized by Pretzel Time in writing, in the event of
expiration or termination  of this  Agreement for any reason,  or upon the sale,
transfer or  assignment  of the  Franchise by  Franchisee,  all of  Franchisee's
rights  hereunder  shall  terminate  and  Franchisee  shall cease to operate the
Franchise.  Franchisee agrees to pay Pretzel Time within fifteen (15) days after
the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, or such later
date that the amounts due to Pretzel Time are  determined,  such  Royalty  Fees,
Advertising  Fund Fees,  amounts owed for purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel
Time or its  Affiliates,  interest  due on any of the  foregoing  and all  other
amounts owed to Pretzel Time or its Affiliates which are then unpaid.
         Expiration or  termination  of this  Agreement for any reason shall not
affect,  modify, or discharge any note, account receivable,  or debt, contingent
or otherwise,  existing or arising under this Agreement, or any prior agreement,
contract, or dealing between Pretzel Time and Franchisee.
         20.B.    DISCONTINUANCE OF MARKS.
         Franchisee  agrees to immediately  discontinue  all use of trade names,
trademarks,  logotypes,  forms of advertising  and other  commercial  symbols of
Pretzel Time, and forms of advertising indicative of Pretzel Time and cancel all
assumed  name  registrations.  Franchisee  further  shall  remove or cause to be
removed all signs and  structures  indicative  of a Pretzel  Time Unit and shall
alter the premises occupied by Franchisee so as to distinguish the same from its
former appearance and from a Pretzel Time franchise.  Further,  Franchisee shall
discontinue  the use of any and all printed goods and materials using said trade
names,  trademarks,  logos and other  commercial  symbols  of Pretzel  Time.  If
Franchisee  refuses to comply  with the terms of this  Section 20 after  Pretzel
Time  requests  compliance,  Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right to enter  upon
Franchisee's  premises  without being deemed guilty of  trespassing or any other
offense,  and make or cause to be made such  changes  at  Franchisee's  expense,
which Franchisee agrees to pay upon demand.
         Franchisee  agrees to not directly or  indirectly at any time or in any
manner (except with respect to other Pretzel Time Units owned by the Franchisee)
identify himself or any business as a current or former Pretzel Time Unit, or as
a franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee
further  agrees to not use any Mark,  any colorable  imitation  thereof or other
indicia of a Pretzel  Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize for
any purpose any trade name,  trade or service  mark or other  commercial  symbol
that suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or its
Affiliates.  Franchisee (or any of its Owners) agrees after  termination he will
not do  business  under any name or in any  manner  that  might tend to give the
general  public the  impression  that he is  associated,  affiliated,  licensed,
franchised by or related to Pretzel Time.  The Franchisee (or any of its Owners)
may not thereafter  use any name,  logo type, or symbol  confusingly  similar toPretzel  Time's  Service  Mark,  logo type or symbol.  If  Franchisee  continues
operating a business at the franchised  location it will exert every  reasonable
effort to inform the public of his new status,  including a change of  telephone
number and advertising materials.
         The Franchise granted to Franchisee  hereunder to sell Products bearing
Pretzel Time's Marks does not include the right to sell or advertise for sale of
Franchisee's  Franchise itself or of its business location.  No advertisement by
Franchisee  or  other  public  solicitation  for  sale of his  interest  in this
Agreement  may  include a  representation  of Pretzel  Time's  trademark  or any
reference to Pretzel Time or its trademark system.
         20.C.    RETURN OF MATERIALS.
         Franchisee  agrees to return to  Pretzel  Time all  signs,  sign-faces,
forms,  invoices,  letterhead,  and  other  materials  containing  any  Mark  or
otherwise identifying or relating to a Pretzel Time Unit and allow Pretzel Time,
without liability to remove all such items from the Unit. Franchisee also agrees
to return all  materials  and  confidential  information  loaned to  Franchisee,
including,  without limitation,  all Operations Manuals and Training Manuals and
videos. Franchisee agrees to return all materials and supplies identified by the
Marks in full cases or  packages  to Pretzel  Time for credit and dispose of all
other materials and supplies, but not equipment,  identified by the Marks within
thirty (30) days after the effective  date of  termination or expiration of this
Agreement.
         20.D.    TELEPHONE COMPANY.
         Franchisee  agrees to notify the  telephone  company and all  telephone
directory  publishers of the termination or expiration of Franchisee's  right to
use any  telephone  and telecopy  numbers and any regular,  classified  or other
telephone  directory  listings  associated  with any Mark and to  authorize  the
transfer  thereof to Pretzel Time or at its direction.  Franchisee  acknowledges
and agrees  that as between  him and  Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time has the sole
rights to and  interest in all  telephone  and  telecopy  numbers and  directory
listings  associated  with any Mark.  Franchisee  authorizes  Pretzel Time,  and
hereby appoints Pretzel Time and any of its officers as Franchisee's attorney in
fact, to direct the telephone company and all telephone directory  publishers to
transfer any telephone and telecopy numbers and directory  listings  relating to
the Pretzel Time Units to Pretzel Time or at its  direction,  should  Franchisee
fail or refuse to do so, and the telephone  company and all telephone  directory
publishers  may accept such direction or this agreement as conclusive of Pretzel
Time's  exclusive  rights in such  telephone and telecopy  numbers and directory
listings  and Pretzel  Time's  authority to direct  their  transfer.  Franchisee
agrees to execute a  collateral  assignment  of  telephone  numbers and listings
agreement  which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In no event shall Pretzel Time
be responsible  for any charges  incurred by Franchisee and associated  with the
telephone company prior to the date of transfer.
         20.E.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
         Franchisee (and its Owners) agrees that upon  termination or expiration
of this Agreement, he will immediately cease to use any Confidential Information
of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates disclosed to him pursuant to this Agreement in
any business or otherwise.  This  provision is also  applicable to the Owners if
the Franchise is a corporation or partnership.
         20.F.    LEASING.
         If Franchisee  has leased the  premises,  Pretzel Time may, in its sole
discretion  and without any  obligation to do so,  assume the lease.  Franchisee
will not be entitled to any refund of the initial franchise fee,  royalties,  or
Advertising Fund Fees.
         20.G.    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.
         Upon  termination of this  Agreement,  in accordance with its terms and
conditions or by Franchisee  without cause, or upon expiration of this Agreement
(unless the Franchise is renewed as provided for in this Agreement),  Franchisee
and its Owners agree that for a period of TWELVE (12) months  commencing  on the
effective  date of  termination  or expiration  or the date on which  Franchisee
complies  with this Section,  whichever is later,  neither  Franchisee,  nor its
Owners,  nor any person or entity  affiliated  with  Franchisee or  Franchisee's
shareholders or partners shall have any direct or indirect  interest  (through a
member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners or otherwise) as a
disclosed or beneficial owner, investor,  partner, director,  officer, employee,
consultant,  representative,  agent or in any other capacity in any  Competitive
Business  located or operating:  (1) at the Site;  (2) within three (3) miles of
the Unit;  and/or (3) within  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit in
operation  or  under  development  on  the  effective  date  of  termination  or
expiration of this  agreement for a period of one year after the  termination or
expiration.  The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the
ownership  of shares of a class of  securities  listed  on a stock  exchange  or
traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of
the  number  of shares  of that  class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.
Franchisee  and its Owners  expressly  acknowledge  that they possess skills and
abilities of a general nature and have other  opportunities  for exploiting such
skills. Consequently, enforcement of the covenants made in this Section will not
deprive the Franchisee or its Owners or shareholders of their personal  goodwill
or ability to earn a living.
The Franchise  Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyondthe termination of the franchise. Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that the
covenant  not to compete is fair and  reasonable,  and will not impose any undue
hardship,  since the Franchisee (and its Owners) has other considerable  skills,
experience and education  which will afford him the opportunity to derive income
from other endeavors.
Neither  Franchisee  nor any of its Owners shall divert or attempt to divert any
business or any customers of any Pretzel Time Unit to any  Competitive  Business
or employ or seek to employ any  person who is  employed  by Pretzel  Time,  its
Affiliates  or a franchisee  of Pretzel Time nor induce or attempt to induce any
such person to leave said  employment  without the prior written consent of such
person's employer.
         20.H.  PRETZEL TIME'S RIGHT TO PURCHASE ASSETS OF THE UNIT.
         Upon  termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time in accordance  with
its terms and  conditions or by Franchisee  without cause or upon  expiration of
this  Agreement  (unless the franchise  has been  renewed),  Pretzel  Time,  its
Affiliates  or  its  assignee  shall  have  the  option  (not  the  obligation),
exercisable  by giving  written  notice  thereof within sixty (60) days from the
date of such  expiration  or  termination,  to acquire from  Franchisee  all the
assets  in the Unit  including  the  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  leasehold
improvements,  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials,  supplies  and other
tangible assets of the Unit and an assignment of the lease for the Unit. Pretzel
Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase.
Pretzel Time or its assignee  shall be entitled to all customary  warranties and
representations  in  connection  with its  asset  purchase,  including,  without
limitation,  representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition of and
title to assets, no liens and encumbrances on the assets,  validity of contracts
and agreements and liabilities  inuring to Pretzel Time or affecting the assets,
contingent or otherwise.
         (1) The purchase price for the assets of the Unit shall be equal to the
greater of:
                  The sum of the book  value  of the  Unit's  assets  (including
                  furnishings,  fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements)
                  amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period
                  plus the lesser of costs and the then-current wholesale market
                  value of all  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials  and
                  supplies (i.e. in good and saleable condition and not obsolete
                  or discontinued), or
                  The  product of the Unit's  average  cash flow for the two (2)
                  most recently  completed  fiscal years  multiplied by two (2).
                  "Cash  flow"  represents  the  Unit's  net  revenues  less all
                  pretzel  unit-related  costs (i.e., cost of goods sold, labor,
                  occupancy   and  other  Unit   expenses)  as  well  as  annual
                  administrative  costs of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and
                  royalty and  service  fees,  but not  including  interest  and
                  depreciation.
         (2)  Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  shall have the right to set off
against and reduce the purchase  price by any and all amounts owed by Franchisee
to Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates.  Pretzel  Time may exclude from the assets
purchased  hereunder any  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  usable  inventory of
Products,  materials  or supplies of the Unit that Pretzel Time has not approved
as meeting its standards for Pretzel Time Unit,  and the purchase price shall be
reduced by the  replacement  costs of such excluded  items which are required in
the operation of the Unit.
         (3) The  purchase  price  shall be paid in cash at the  closing  of the
purchase, which shall take place no later than ninety (90) days after receipt by
Franchisee  of Pretzel  Time's notice of exercise of this option to purchase the
Unit, at which time Franchisee shall deliver instruments transferring to Pretzel
Time or its assignee good and merchantable  title to the assets purchased,  free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances  with all sales and other transfer taxes
paid by  Franchisee,  and all  licenses  or  permits  of the Unit  which  may be
assigned or transferred. In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur
within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in
connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%).
Franchisee  further agrees that the purchase  price shall be further  reduced by
ten percent (10%) per month for each subsequent  month  Franchisee  fails to act
diligently to consummate this  transaction.  In the event that Franchisee cannot
deliver clear title to all of the purchased assets as aforesaid, or in the event
there are other unresolved  issues, at Pretzel Time's option,  the losing of the
sale shall be accomplished through an escrow.  Prior to closing,  Franchisee and
Pretzel  Time shall  comply with the  applicable  Bulk Sales  provisions  of the
Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the state in which the Unit is located.
         (4) If Pretzel Time or its assignee  exercises this option to purchase,
pending  the  closing of such  purchase,  Pretzel  Time may appoint a manager to
maintain the operation of the Unit, at its option,  require  Franchisee to close
the Unit during such time period  without  removing any assets.  If Pretzel Time
appoints a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit pending closing of such
purchase, all funds from the Unit's operation during the period of management by
a  Pretzel  Time  appointed  manager  shall be kept in a  separate  fund and all
expenses of the Unit, including compensation,  other costs and travel and living
expenses of the Pretzel Time appointed  manager,  shall be charged to such fund.
As compensation for the management services provided,  Pretzel Time shall charge
such fund ten  percent  (10%) of the  Unit's net  revenues  during the period of
Pretzel Time's management. Operation of the Unit during any such period shall be
for and on behalf of  Franchisee,  provided  that Pretzel Time shall have a duty
only to utilize its good faith  efforts and shall not be liable to Franchisee orits Owners for any debts,  losses or obligations  incurred by the Unit or to any
creditor  of  Franchisee  for any  merchandise  materials,  supplies  or service
purchased by the Unit during any period in which it is managed by Pretzel Time's
appointed  manager.  Franchisee  shall maintain in force all insurance  policies
required for the Unit until the date of closing.
21.      RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION.
         21.A.    EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.
         Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to
protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and
would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among
Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold
interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified
in Exhibit C.  Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the
Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's
agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  therefore agrees
that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which

         operating  at the Site or within  three (3) miles of any  Pretzel  Time
         Unit  in  operation  or  under  development  on the  effective  date of
         termination or expiration of this Agreement, except a Pretzel Time Unit
         operated by Franchisee under Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time; or
         (2) Recruit or hire any employee who, within the immediately  preceding
         six (6) month period,  was employed by Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time
         Unit operated by Pretzel Time, its Affiliates or another  franchisee or
         licensee  of  Pretzel  Time,   without   obtaining  the  prior  written
         permission of Pretzel Time or such franchisee.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from
owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter
market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.
         Covenants contained in this Section shall be construed as severable and
independent,   and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied   consistent  with  the
requirements  of  reasonableness.  Any judicial  reformation of these  covenants
consistent  with this  interpretation  shall be enforceable as though  contained
herein  and shall not affect any other  provisions  or terms of this  Agreement.
This non-compete provision may not be enforceable under the laws of your state.
         21.B.  NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.
         Franchisee shall not employ any of the Marks in signing any contract or
applying  for any  franchise or permit or in a manner that may result in Pretzel
Time's  liability for any of Franchisee's  indebtedness or obligations,  nor may
Franchisee  use the Marks in any way not  expressly  authorized by Pretzel Time.
Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee
shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or
representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other,
represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or
be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations
made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.  Pretzel Time
shall not be  obligated  for any damages to any person or  property  directly or
indirectly  arising out of the  operation of the Unit or  Franchisee's  business
authorized by or conducted pursuant to this Agreement.
         21.C.    TAXES.
         Pretzel  Time shall have no  liability  for any  sales,  use,  service,
occupation,  excise,  gross receipts,  income,  property or other taxes, whether
levied upon Franchisee, the Unit, Franchisee's property or upon Pretzel Time, in
connection with the sales made or business  conducted by Franchisee.  Payment of
all such taxes shall be Franchisee's responsibility.
         21.D.    INDEMNIFICATION.
         Franchisee   agrees  to  indemnify   and  hold  Pretzel  Time  and  its
subsidiaries,  Affiliates, stockholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents
and assignees harmless against, and to reimburse them for, any loss,  liability,
judgment  or damages  (actual or  consequential)  and all  reasonable  costs and
expenses of  defending  any claim  brought  against any of them or any action in
which any of them is named as a party (including, without limitation, reasonable
accountants,  attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs of investigation,  court

will, travel expenses) which any of them may suffer,  sustain or incur by reason
of, arising from or in connection  with  Franchisee's  ownership or operation of
the Unit, unless such loss, liability or damage is only due to the negligence of
Pretzel  Time  (or  its  Affiliates,  subsidiaries).  Pretzel  Time's  right  to
indemnity  under  this  agreement  shall  arise  notwithstanding  that  joint or
concurrent  liability  may be  imposed on Pretzel  Time by  statute,  ordinance,
regulation or other law.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that any action or
inaction by any third party which is not an  Affiliate of Pretzel Time shall notbe attributable to or constitute negligence of Pretzel Time. The indemnities and
assumptions of liabilities and  obligations  herein shall continue in full force

         Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee of any claims and Franchisee shall
be given the  opportunity  to assume the  defense of the matter.  If  Franchisee
fails to assume the defense  within  three (3) days of notice  thereof,  Pretzel
Time may defend the action in the manner reasonably appropriate,  and Franchisee
shall pay to Pretzel Time all reasonable  costs,  including  without  limitation
attorney's  fees,  court  costs,  expert  witness  fees,  travel  and  telephone
expenses, incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting such defense, in addition to any
such sum which Pretzel Time may pay by reason of any settlement agreed to by the
parties or reasonably  negotiated by Pretzel Time in the event  Franchisee fails
to assume the defense, or judgment against Pretzel Time.
         21.E.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.
         It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that Franchisee is an
independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venturer, or employee
of  Pretzel  Time.  Pretzel  Time and  Franchisee  agree  that  nothing  in this
Agreement  is  intended  to  create  a  fiduciary   relationship  between  them.
Franchisee  shall have no right to bind or obligate  Pretzel Time in any way nor
shall he  represent  that he has any right to do so.  Pretzel Time shall have no
control over the terms and conditions of employment of Franchisee's employees.
         In all public records and in his  relationship  with other persons,  on
stationery, business forms and checks, Franchisee shall indicate his independent
ownership of the  franchised  Unit and that he is a franchisee  of Pretzel Time.
Franchisee  shall exhibit on the premises in such places as may be designated by
Pretzel  Time,  a Pretzel  Time  approved  notice  that the  franchised  Unit is
operated by an  independent  operator and not by Pretzel Time or Pretzel  Time's
Affiliates,  which operate company owned  franchises.  Franchisee shall take all
legal  steps  such as a  fictitious  name  registration  to ensure  Franchisee's
independent business status.

Information"):
         (1)  methods,   techniques,   equipment,   specifications,   standards,
         policies, procedures, information, concepts and systems relating to and
         knowledge  of  and  experience  in  the   development,   operation  and
         franchising of Pretzel Time Units:
         (2) site selection criteria;
         (3) marketing and promotional programs for Pretzel Time Units;
         (4) recipes, ingredients,  formulas, mixes, spices, seasonings, sauces,
         recipes for, and methods for the preparation,  cooking,  and serving of
         the Products;
         (5)  techniques,  formats,  specifications,  systems,  procedures,  and
         knowledge of and experience in the development and operation of Pretzel
         Time Units;
         (6) knowledge of specifications  for and suppliers of certain Products,
         materials, supplies, equipment, furnishings and fixtures;
         (7) sales data and information  concerning  inventory  requirements for
         Products,  materials and supplies, and specifications for and knowledge
         of suppliers of certain materials,  equipment, and fixtures for Pretzel
         Time Units;

         (10) information concerning Product sales, operating results, financial
         performance and other financial data of Pretzel Time Units.
         Pretzel Time will disclose such parts of the  Confidential  Information
as  Pretzel  Time deems  necessary  or  advisable  from time to time in its sole
discretion  for the  operation  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit to  Franchisee  during
training, and in guidance and assistance furnished to Franchisee during the term
of the Franchise, and Franchisee may learn or otherwise obtain from Pretzel Time
additional  Confidential  Information  of  Pretzel  Time  during the term of the
Franchise.  Franchisee acknowledges that the foregoing Confidential  Information
is highly  confidential.  Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees  that he will not
acquire  any  interest  in  Confidential  Information,  other  than the right to
utilize Confidential Information disclosed to Franchisee in the operation of the
Pretzel  Time  Unit  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  that the use or
duplication  of  any  Confidential  Information  in  any  other  business  would
constitute an unfair method of competition. Franchisee, including its directors,officers,  shareholders,  and partners agree(s) that Confidential Information is
proprietary,  includes  trade  secrets  of  Pretzel  Time  and is  disclosed  to
Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee  agrees,  and Franchisee (and
its Owners) does hereby agree, that he:
         (1) shall not disclose any  information  pertaining to the Pretzel Time
         System,  directly or indirectly,  to any person,  natural or corporate,
         without the express prior written  consent of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee
         may disclose to its Unit Manager such  information  deemed necessary to
         disclose,  provided  such Unit  Manager  has  agreed to  maintain  such
         information in confidence in Pretzel Time's  confidentiality  agreement
         and Pretzel Time has received such executed agreement  (attached hereto
         as Exhibit H);
         (2) Will not use  Confidential  Information  in any other  business  or
capacity;
         (3)  Will  maintain  the  absolute   confidentiality   of  Confidential
         Information during and after the term of this Agreement;
         (4) Will not make  unauthorized  copies of any portion of  Confidential
         Information disclosed in written or other tangible form; and
         (5) Will adopt and implement  all  reasonable  procedures  that Pretzel
         Time  prescribes  from  time  to time to  prevent  unauthorized  use or
         disclosure of Confidential Information,  including, without limitation,
         restrictions on disclosure thereof to his employees.
         This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  not apply in a  judicial  or
administrative  proceeding  to the extent  Franchisee  is legally  compelled  to
disclose such information,  provided Franchisee shall have used his best efforts
and shall have afforded  Pretzel Time the  opportunity  to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other assurance satisfactory to Pretzel Time of confidential
treatment for the information required to be so disclosed.  This restrictions on
Franchisee's  disclosure and use of the Confidential  Information shall also not
apply to the  disclosure of  information,  methods,  procedures,  techniques and
knowledge which are or become  generally  known in the food service  business in
the Territory, other than through disclosure (whether deliberate or inadvertent)
by Franchisee.
         Notwithstanding   the  foregoing  and  any  other   provision  of  this
Agreement,  Franchisee may use the  Confidential  Information in connection with
the operation of other Pretzel Time Units (in addition to the Unit)  pursuant to
other Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time.
         22.B.  DISCLOSURE OF IDEAS AND NEW PROCEDURES.
         Franchisee  shall  fully and  promptly  disclose to Pretzel  Time,  all
ideas,  concepts,  methods  and  techniques  relating  to  the  development  and
operation  of a dessert or snack food  business  conceived  or  developed by the
Franchisee  and/or  Franchisee's  employees  during the term of this  Agreement.
Franchisee  agrees and grants to Pretzel Time and its Affiliates a perpetual and
worldwide  right to use and  authorize  other  Pretzel  Time Units or other food
service businesses  operated by Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  franchisees and
designees  to  use  such  ideas,  recipes,  formulas,   concepts,  methods,  and
techniques  relating to the development  and/or  operation of a dessert or snack
food business.  If incorporated into the Pretzel Time System for the development
and/or operation of Pretzel Time Units, such ideas, recipes, formulas, concepts,
methods and techniques  shall become the sole and exclusive  property of Pretzel
Time without any further consideration to Franchisee. Pretzel Time shall have no
obligation to make any lump sum or on-going  payments to Franchisee with respect
to any such idea, concept, method, technique or product.  Franchisee agrees that
Franchisee  will not use nor will it allow any other person or entity to use any
such concept,  method,  technique or product  without  obtaining  Pretzel Time's
prior written approval.

         The rights of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  hereunder are cumulative and
no exercise or  enforcement by Pretzel Time or Franchisee of any right or remedy

Franchisee  of any  other  right  or  remedy  herein  or which  Pretzel  Time or
Franchisee is entitled by law to enforce.
         23.C.    WAIVER OF OBLIGATIONS.
         Pretzel Time may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any
obligation  of  or  restriction  upon  Franchisee  under  this  Agreement,   and
Franchisee may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation
of or  restriction  upon  Pretzel  Time under  this  Agreement,  effective  upon
delivery of written  notice  thereof to the other or such other  effective  date
stated on the notice of waiver.  Whenever this Agreement requires Pretzel Time'sprior  approval  or  consent,  Franchisee  shall make a timely  written  request
therefore, and such approval shall be obtained in writing. Pretzel Time makes no
warranties  or  guaranties  upon  which  Franchisee  may rely,  and  assumes  no
liability or  obligation  to  Franchisee,  by granting  any waiver,  approval or
consent to  Franchisee,  or by reason of any  neglect,  delay,  or denial of any
request therefore. Any waiver granted by Pretzel Time shall be without prejudice

to continuing review by Pretzel Time, and may be revoked, in Pretzel Time's sole
discretion,  at any  time  and  for  any  reason,  effective  upon  delivery  to
Franchisee of ten (10) days' prior written notice.
         23.D.    CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.
          All  obligations of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  which expressly or by
their very nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement  shall
continue  in  full  force  and  effect  subsequent  to and  notwithstanding  its
expiration  or  termination  and until  they are  satisfied  or by their  nature
expire.
         23.E.    INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS.
         If any provisions of this  Agreement,  or its application to any person
or  circumstance,  is deemed  invalid or  unenforceable  by a court of competent
jurisdiction,  then the remainder of this  Agreement or the  application of such
provision  to other  persons or  circumstances  shall not be  affected  thereby,
provided,  however,  that if any provision or application  thereof is invalid or
unenforceable,  the court shall  substitute a suitable and  equitable  provision
therefore  in order to carry out,  so far as may be valid and  enforceable,  the
intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.
         If any applicable and binding law or rule of any jurisdiction  requires
a  greater  prior  notice  of the  termination  of or  refusal  to enter  into a
successor Franchise  Agreement to this Agreement than is required hereunder,  or
the  taking of some  other  action  not  required  hereunder,  or if,  under any
applicable  and binding law or rule of any  jurisdiction,  any provision of this
Agreement  or any  standard or procedure  outlined in the  Operations  Manual is
invalid or unenforceable,  the prior notice and/or other action required by such
law or rule shall be  substituted  for the  comparable  provisions  hereof,  and
Pretzel  Time shall  have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to modify  such
invalid or unenforceable operations procedure or standard to the extent required
to be valid and enforceable.

agrees that any noncompliance with the restrictive  covenants  contained herein,
including  without  limitation  those provisions  pertaining to  noncompetition,
confidentiality  and the improper or  unauthorized  use of Pretzel  Time's Marks
will cause  irreparable  damage to Pretzel Time and its franchisees.  Franchisee
therefore agrees that should it violate any restrictive covenant, or threaten to
breach the  restrictive  covenants,  then Pretzel Time shall be entitled to both
permanent  and temporary  injunctive  relief,  without  bond,  from any court of
competent  jurisdiction  in addition to any other remedies to which Pretzel Time
may be entitled,  at law or in equity,  under this agreement or otherwise  under
applicable law.

contingent  upon the full execution of and performance of all obligations by the
parties  under this  Agreement.  This  Agreement is expressly  conditional  upon
Franchisee  executing all documents  required by this Agreement  within ten (10)
days of receipt of the document.  Failure by Franchisee to execute any documents
shall result in the Agreement being null and void.
         In addition during Franchisee's  training,  all documents pertaining to
the  franchising of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time Unit shall be held in escrow by
Pretzel Time. Title in and to the Pretzel Time Unit shall not pass to Franchisee
until  Franchisee  has  been  trained  as  a  Pretzel  Time  franchisee  to  the
satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If Franchisee  fails to  satisfactorily  complete
Pretzel Time initial  training,  the appointment of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time
franchisee  and the granting of the franchise  business to  Franchisee  shall be
null and void, all documents executed between Franchisee and Pretzel Time or its
designees with respect to the transaction shall be terminated and cancelled. The
Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the Franchise fee shall be
refunded if Franchisee  fails to complete  Pretzel Time's initial training class
to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If the  Franchisee  completes the initial
training to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time will  provide to
Franchisee fully signed copies of the Franchise Agreement.
         It is  understood  and agreed by the parties  that the  granting of the
franchise  and all  contracts  and  agreements  entered  into by and between the
parties with respect to the Unit are specifically contingent upon the signing of
a lease for the Site.  In the event that a lease for the Site cannot be obtained
on or before sixty (60) days after  delivery of Pretzel  Time's  approval of the
Site at no fault  or delay by  Franchisee,  then all  contracts  and  agreements
entered into by Pretzel Time, and  Franchisee  shall become null and void and of
no effect,  and all monies  deposited by Franchisee less a nonrefundable  fee of
$2,500 shall be refunded.
         23.L.    WAIVER BY PRETZEL TIME.
         No waiver by  Pretzel  Time of any  default  or  failure  to perform by
Franchisee,  or of any  breach of the  terms of this  Agreement  or no  failure,
refusal or neglect of Pretzel Time to exercise any right,  option or power given
it under this Agreement,  shall preclude Pretzel Time from thereafter  requiring
strict  compliance or from declaring  this  Agreement and the franchise  granted
herein  revoke or  terminated.  The failure of Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this
Agreement upon the occurrence of one or more Acts of Default will not constitute
a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  the right of  Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this
Franchise  because of a continuing or subsequent  failure to cure one or more of
the aforesaid events of default or any other default.
         23.M.    COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.
         If a claim  for  amounts  owed by  Franchisee  to  Pretzel  Time or its
Affiliates  is  asserted  in any  judicial or  arbitration  proceeding  or later
appeal,  or if Pretzel Time is required to enforce the Franchise  Agreement in a
judicial or arbitration proceeding or later appeal, the prevailing party will be
entitled  to  reimbursement  of its costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable
arbitrators',  accountants'  and  legal  fees,  whether  incurred  prior  to, in
preparation for or in contemplation of the filing of any written demand,  claim,
action,  hearing or  proceeding  to enforce  the  obligations  of the  Franchise
Agreement.  If Pretzel Time incurs  expenses in connection  with your failure to
pay when due amounts  owing to Pretzel  Time,  to submit  when due any  reports,
information  or  supporting  records or otherwise  to comply with the  Franchise
Agreement,  including,  but not limited to legal,  arbitrators'  and  accounting

WHEREAS, Grantor, at a duly authorized and regular meeting of its Town Council, did vote to grant a renewal of the Gas

_______________ ("you").  If you are a corporation, partnership or limited
liability company, certain provisions of the Agreement also apply to your owners
and will be noted.
                                    BACKGROUND:
       A.   Our parent company has developed a unique system ("System") for
establishing and operating restaurants which use the service mark "BUFFALO WILD
WINGS" and which feature chicken wings, sandwiches, and other products and
beverages, which are all prepared according to specified recipes and procedures
("Menu Items"), some of which use proprietary mixes ("Trade Secret Food
Products"), and has granted to us the right to sublicense the System to others.
       B.   The distinguishing characteristics of the System include, without
limitation, distinctive exterior and interior layout, design and color scheme,
signage, decorations, furnishings and materials, special recipes, formulae,
menus and food and beverage designations, Confidential Manuals, food and
beverage storage, preparation service and delivery procedures and techniques,
operating procedures for sanitation and maintenance, and methods and techniques
for inventory and cost controls, record keeping and reporting, purchasing, sales
promotion and advertising, Trade Secret Food Products, all of which may bechanged, improved and further developed from time to time.
       C.   Our parent company is the owner of the trade names, service marks
and trademarks "BUFFALO WILD WINGS", "bw-3" and other logos and commercial
symbols, and such other trade names, service marks, and trademarks as are now
designated (and may later be designated by us in writing) as part of the System
("Marks").
       D.   We grant franchises to qualified candidates for the operation of
"Buffalo Wild Wings" Restaurants offering the Menu Items and utilizing the
System and Marks.  You desire to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings Restaurant using
the System and Marks and have applied for a franchise, which application has
been approved by us in reliance upon all of the representations you have made.
       E.   You understand and acknowledge the importance of our high and
uniform standards of quality and service and the necessity of operating the
Buffalo Wild Wings business in conformity with our standards and specifications.
                                    AGREEMENTS:
       We and you agree as follows:
I.     APPOINTMENT AND FRANCHISE FEE
       A.   Subject to the provisions stated below, we hereby grant you a
license to use the "Buffalo Wild Wings" Marks and System, and you undertake the
obligation to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant facility featuring the
Menu Items and providing sit-down, carry-out and other restaurant services
("Franchised
                                          1
Restaurant"), and to use the Marks solely in connection with the System, as it
is currently established, and as it may be changed, improved and further
developed from time to time, at one (1) location only, such location to be:
1) ____________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________, or
2)  at a location to be designated, as provided in Paragraph III within the area
described on EXHIBIT B.  When a location has been designated and approved by you
and us, it will become part of Paragraph I.A.1., as if originally incorporated
in that Paragraph.  You shall not relocate your Franchised Restaurant without
our prior written approval.
       B.   You receive a Designated Area within which we and our affiliates
shall not operate or grant to anyone else a franchise to operate a Buffalo Wild
Wings or bw-3 Restaurant so long as this Agreement is in force and effect.  The
Designated Area is described in writing and on a map attached to the Agreement
as EXHIBIT B and is made a part of the Agreement.  You do not have any right to
sublicense or subfranchise others within or outside of the Designated Area and
do not have the right to operate more than one (1) Franchised Restaurant within
the Designated Area.
       C.   You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole
discretion, to grant other franchises outside of the Designated Area as we deem
appropriate.  Although we will not operate a Buffalo Wild Wings or bw-3 business
within the Designated Area, we reserve the right, both within and outside of the
Designated Area, to offer and sell at special events (at our option, if you

reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to vary standards for any System
franchisee based upon the peculiarities of the particular site or circumstance,
density of population, business potential, population of trade area, existing
business practices or any other condition which we deem to be of importance to
the successful operation of such franchisee's business.  You shall not be
entitled to require us to grant to you a like or similar variation.G.   In consideration of our agreement not to grant another franchise in

expiration and/or termination of the franchise.  You will at all times insure
that your copy of the Manuals are available at the Franchised Restaurant
premises in a current and up-to-date manner.  At all times that the Manuals are
not in use by authorized personnel, you will maintain the Manuals in a locked
receptacle at the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, and will only grant
authorized personnel, as defined in the Manuals, access to the key or lock
combination of such receptacle.  In the event of any dispute as to the contents
of the Manuals, the terms of the master copy of the Manuals maintained by us at
our home office will be controlling.
VII.        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

Buffalo Wild Wings business, including, without limitation, the method of

proprietary, confidential and our trade secret.  You will maintain the absolute
confidentiality of all such information during and after the term of the
franchise and you will not use any such information in any other business or in
any manner not specifically authorized or approved in writing by us.

information, Marks and Manuals, you acknowledge that we will be entitled to
immediate equitable remedies, including but not limited to, restraining orders
and injunctive relief in order to safeguard our proprietary, confidential,
unique, and special information and you acknowledge that money damages alone
would be an insufficient remedy with which to compensate us for any breach of
the terms of Paragraph V, VI and VII of this Agreement.  All of your employees
having access to our confidential and proprietary information and all of your
shareholders, directors, officers, partners and/or members will be required to

wrapping papers.  In the event written disapproval of any such advertising and
promotional material has not been given by us to you within twenty (20) days
from the date such information has been received by us, the materials will be
deemed approved.  Your failure to conform with these provisions and subsequent
nonaction by us to require you to cure or remedy any such failure and default
will not be deemed a waiver of future or additional failures and defaults by you
under this provision and/or any other provision of this Agreement.  The
submission of advertising information to us for our approval will not affect
your right to determine the prices at which you sell your products and/or
services.
       B.   You will contribute to the Buffalo Wild Wings Advertising and
Development Fund ("Fund") (which may be one of several regional Funds, if we
elect to establish separate Funds to serve various regions in which multiple
franchisees are located) an amount equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross
Sales, as defined in Paragraph X.  Your required payments to the Fund will be
made on or before the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month.  These
contributions may be withdrawn from your bank account as provided in Paragraph
X.  We will use such funds to conduct local, regional or national advertising.
Such payments shall be made in addition to and exclusive of any sums that you
may be required to spend on system or grand opening advertising and promotion.
The Fund shall be maintained and administered by us or our designee, as follows:
            1.    We will oversee all advertising programs and have sole
discretion over the creative concepts, materials and media used in such programs
including the placement and allocation.  We will use the Fund to conduct
national advertising, and/or, if regional Funds are developed, to conduct
regional or local advertising on your behalf, at our sole discretion.  We may
also use such funds to conduct advertising in your local advertising market.
However, we cannot and do not ensure that any particular franchisee will benefit
directly or pro rata from the placement of advertising.
                                          8
            2.    For each of our company-owned and affiliate-owned Restaurants
(except Special Sites identified in Paragraph I.C.) offering products and
services similar to the Franchised Restaurant we will make contributions to the
Fund or to regional Funds equivalent to the contributions required of Franchised
Restaurants within the System or, if applicable, region in which the
company-owned or affiliate-owned store is located.
            3.    We will administer and control the Fund and we will have the
absolute and unilateral right to determine how, when and where the monies in the
Fund will be spent.  This includes the right to use Fund monies for (1) the
creation, development and production of advertising and promotional materials,
(2) any marketing or related research and development, and (3) advertising and

provider costs, Internet/World Wide Web programming and advertising,
subscriptions to industry newsletters or magazines, marketing or industry
studies, books and research materials, administrative costs and salaries for
marketing support personnel.  All sums paid by you to the Fund will be
maintained in a separate account from our other funds and shall not be used to
defray any of our general operating expenses, except for such reasonable
administrative costs and overhead, if any, as we may incur in activities
reasonably related to the administration or direction of the Fund and
advertising programs including, without limitation, costs incurred in collecting
and accounting for assessments for the Fund.
            4.    It is our intent that all contributions to the Fund will be
expended for advertising and promotional purposes during our fiscal year within
which contributions are made.  Any monies not expended in the fiscal year in
which they were contributed will be applied and used for Fund expenses in the
following year.
            5.    Although we intend the Fund to be of perpetual duration, we
have the right to terminate the Fund.  We will not terminate the Fund, however,
until all monies in the Fund have been expended for advertising and promotional
purposes.6.    An unaudited accounting of Fund contributions and expenditures
will be prepared annually and will be made available to you upon request.  At
our option, any such annual accounting may include an audit of the contributions
and expenditures of the Fund prepared by an independent certified public
accountant selected by us and prepared at the expense of the Fund.
            7.    Once you make contributions to the Fund, all such monies will
be used as required by this Paragraph IX and will not be returned to you.
       C.   In addition to your contributions to the Fund, you may be required
to spend up to two percent (2%) of your Gross Sales on approved local
advertising.  We may direct that your local advertising expenditures be made
either individually or to a local advertising group as described below.
            1.    We shall have the right to designate local advertising markets
and you will participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs in
your designated local advertising market as described in this Paragraph.  Each
Buffalo Wild Wings and bw-3 Restaurant (except Special Sites identified in
Paragraph I.C.) within the designated local advertising area shall be a member
of the local advertising group and each member shall have one vote on all
matters requiring a vote.  We reserve the right to designate the Bylaws which
will govern the operation of local advertising groups.
                                          9
            2.    If we direct you to spend your advertising funds locally, all
such expenditures will be made directly by you or the local advertising group,
subject to approval and direction by us or our designated advertising agency.
You acknowledge that we may direct local advertising to be spent according to a
seasonally adjusted schedule; however, such expenditures shall not exceed two
percent (2%) of your annual Gross Sales.  You shall furnish to us an accurate
accounting of all expenditures on local advertising and promotion.
            3.    You will submit documentation of your advertising expenditures
at such times and in such form as we designate.  If you fail to make any
required advertising expenditures, we have the right to require you to
contribute the amount of any deficiency to the Fund to be used by us for general
advertising and promotion.
       D.   We may require you to expend up to FIVE THOUSAND Dollars ($5,000) on
newspaper, direct mail or advertising through other media prior to your opening

Each party will pay their own appraiser and the cost of the third appraiser will
be shared equally by the parties.  If we elect to exercise any option to

such offer is not so accepted within six (6) months of the date thereof, we will
again have the right of first refusal herein described.
XXI.   OPERATION IN THE EVENT OF ABSENCE, DISABILITY OR DEATH
       In order to prevent any interruption of the Franchised Restaurant which
would cause harm to the Franchised Restaurant and thereby depreciate the value
thereof, you authorize us, in the event that you are absent or incapacitated by
reason of illness or death and are not, therefore, in our sole judgment, able to
operate the Franchised Restaurant, to operate the Franchised Restaurant for so
long as we deem necessary and practical, and without waiver of any other rights
or remedies we may have under this Agreement.  Provided, however, that we shall
not be obligated to so operate the Franchised Restaurant.  All monies from the
operation of the business during such period of operation by us shall be kept in
a separate account and the expenses of the Franchised Restaurant, including
reasonable compensation and expenses for our representative, shall be charged to
said account.  If, as herein provided, we temporarily operate for you the
Franchised Restaurant, you will indemnify and hold us harmless and any
representative of ours who may act hereunder, from any and all claims arising
from
                                          26
the operation of the Franchised Restaurant, including, without limitation, our
acts and omissions and acts and omissions of our representatives.
XXII.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND INDEMNIFICATION
       A.   This Agreement does not make, appoint or constitute you as our
agent, legal representative, joint venturer, partner, employee, or servant for
any purpose whatsoever.  You cannot represent to third parties that you are our
agent and it is understood between the parties that you will be an independent
contractor who is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty
or representation on our behalf, or to create any obligation, express or
implied, on our behalf.  As an independent entrepreneur, you are solely
responsible for the control,  management and day-to-day operation of the
Franchised Restaurant, including but not limited to, such matters as determining
the prices at which you will offer and sell approved products and services,
hiring and discharging your employees and setting and paying wages and benefits
of your employees and that we will have no power, responsibility or liability
with respect to such pricing, hiring, discharging, setting and paying of wages
or related matters.  All standards of quality and performance, including those
listed in Paragraph XII, are established to promote and protect the value of the
Marks and the System and to insure optimum quality control as to products and
services.  You alone are responsible for the food production and preparation at
the Franchised Restaurant.
       B.   You will prominently display, by posting of a sign within public
view, on or in the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, a statement that
clearly indicates that the Franchised Restaurant is independently owned and
operated by you as a franchisee and not as an agent.
       C.   You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliates
harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages and liabilities,
however caused, arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in
connection with, the use and operation of the Franchised Restaurant, as well as
the costs, including attorneys' fees, of defending against them (hereinafter are
"Franchise Claims").  Franchise Claims include, but are not limited to, those
arising from any death, personal injury or property damage (whether caused
wholly or in part through our active or passive negligence), latent, or other
defects in the Franchised Restaurant, or your employment practices.  In the
event a Franchise Claim is made against us, we reserve the right in our sole
discretion to select our own legal counsel to represent our interests and you
will reimburse us for our attorneys' fees immediately upon our request as they
are incurred.XXIII. MISCELLANEOUS
       A.   Our failure to exercise any power reserved to us hereunder, or to
insist upon strict compliance by you with any obligation or condition hereunder,
and any custom or practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof,
shall not constitute a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the
terms hereof.  Our waiver of any default by you shall not be binding unless in
writing and executed by us and shall not affect or impair our right with respect
to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature.
       B.   Any and all notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be personally delivered, mailed by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or sent overnight courier to the respective parties at

conflict with any existing or future law or regulation, such shall not impair
the operation of or affect the remaining portions, sections, parts, terms and/or
provisions of this Agreement, and the latter will continue to be given full
force and effect and bind the parties hereto; and said invalid sections, parts,
terms and/or provisions shall be reformed to most nearly implement the
intentions of the parties hereto or, if reformation is not possible, be deemed
not part of this Agreement; provided, however, that if we determine that said
finding of illegality adversely affects the basic consideration of this
Agreement, we may, at our option, terminate this Agreement.  Anything to the
contrary herein notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor
shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than you and us
and such of their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by
this Agreement, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.
XXIV.  APPLICABLE LAW
       A.   THIS AGREEMENT TAKES EFFECT UPON ITS ACCEPTANCE AND EXECUTION BY US,

FRANCHISED RESTAURANT IS LOCATED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT GOVERNED BY THE UNITED
STATES TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946 (LANHAM ACT, 15, U.S.C. SECTIONS 1051 ET SEQ).  YOU

SHALL ALSO BE CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE FRANCHISED
RESTAURANT IS LOCATED.
                                          28
       B.   ANY ACTION SOUGHT TO BE BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY OR ANY ACTION
BROUGHT BY YOU AGAINST OUR PARENT OR OTHER AFFILIATE, SHALL BE BROUGHT IN THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OR THE STATE DISTRICT COURT IN THE STATE IN WHICHOUR COMPANY HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE
LOCATION IS HENNEPIN COUNTY, MINNESOTA.  THE PARTIES DO HEREBY WAIVE ALL
QUESTIONS OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION OR VENUE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CARRYING OUT
THIS PROVISION.
       C.   NO RIGHT OR REMEDY CONFERRED UPON OR RESERVED TO US OR YOU BY THIS
AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHALL BE DEEMED, EXCLUSIVE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT
OR REMEDY HEREIN OR BY LAW OR EQUITY PROVIDED OR PERMITTED, BUT EACH SHALL BE
CUMULATIVE OF EVERY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY.
       D.   NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL BAR OUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AGAINST THREATENED CONDUCT THAT WILL CAUSE US LOSS OR DAMAGES, UNDER THE
USUAL EQUITY RULES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE RULES FOR OBTAINING RESTRAINING
ORDERS AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS.
XXV.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION
       A.   The parties have entered into this Agreement in good faith and in
the belief that it is mutually advantageous to them.  It is with that same
spirit of cooperation that they pledge to attempt to resolve any dispute
amicably without the necessity of litigation.  Accordingly, they agree that
except as set forth below, if any dispute arises between them relating to this
Agreement that prior to the commencement of any legal action to interpret or
enforce this Agreement, they will first use the procedures specified in this
Section.
       B.   The party seeking to initiate the procedure shall give written
notice to the other party, describing in general terms the nature of the
dispute, the claim for relief and identifying one or more individuals with
authority to settle the dispute on such party's behalf.  The party receiving
such notice shall have ten (10) business days within which to designate by
written notice one or more individuals with authority to settle the dispute on
such party's behalf.
       C.   The authorized individuals shall be entitled to make such
investigation of the dispute as they deem appropriate, but agree to meet
promptly, and in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of the
initial written notice, to discuss resolution of the dispute.  The authorized
individuals shall meet at such times and places and with such frequency as they
may agree.  If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days from
the date of their initial meeting, the parties shall cease direct negotiations
and shall submit the dispute to mediation in accordance with the following
procedure.
       D.   The authorized individuals shall have five (5) business days from
the date they cease direct negotiations to submit to each other a written list
of acceptable qualified mediators not affiliated with any of the parties.
Within five (5) days from the date of receipt of such list, the authorized
individuals shall rank the mediators in numerical order of preference and
exchange such rankings.  If one or more names are on both lists, the highest
ranking person shall be designated as the mediator.  If no mediator has been
selected under this procedure, the parties agree jointly to request the local
administrative judge of the County in which our corporate headquarters are
situated to supply within ten (10) business days a list of potential qualified
mediators.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of the list, the parties
shall again rank the proposed mediators in numerical order of preference and
shall simultaneously exchange such lists and shall select as the mediator the
individual
                                          29
receiving the highest combined ranking.  If such mediator is not available to
serve, they shall proceed to contact the mediator who was next highest in
ranking until they are able to select a mediator.
       E.   In consultation with the mediator selected, the parties shall
promptly designate a mutually convenient time and place for the mediation, and
unless circumstances require otherwise, such time is to be not later than
forty-five (45) days after selection of the mediator.  In the event any party to
this Agreement has substantial need for information in the possession of another
party to this Agreement in order to prepare for the mediation, all parties shall
attempt in good faith to agree on procedures for the expeditious exchange of
such information, with the help of the mediator if required.  At least seven (7)
days prior to the first scheduled session of the mediation, each party shall
deliver to the mediator and to the other party a concise written summary of its
views on the matter in dispute, and such other matters required by the mediator.
The mediator may also request that a confidential issue paper be submitted to
him by each party.
       F.   In the mediation, each party shall be represented by an authorized
individual and may be represented by counsel.  In addition, each party may, with
permission of the mediator, bring such additional persons as are needed to
respond to questions, contribute information and participate in the
negotiations.
       G.   The mediator shall determine the format for the meetings, designed
to assure that both the mediator and the authorized individuals have an
opportunity to hear an oral presentation of each party's views on the matter in
dispute, and that the authorized parties attempt to negotiate a resolution of
the matter in dispute, with or without the assistance of counsel or others, but
with the assistance of the mediator.  To this end, the mediator is authorized to
conduct both joint meetings and separate private caucuses with the parties.  The
mediation session shall be private.  The mediator will keep confidential all
information learned in private caucus with any party unless specificallyauthorized by such party to make disclosure of the information to the other
party.  The parties agree to sign a document agreeing that the mediator shall be
governed by the provisions of the local Rules of Civil Procedure and such other
rules as the mediator shall prescribe.  The parties commit to participate in the
proceedings in good faith with the intention of resolving the dispute, if at all
possible.
       H.   The parties agree to participate in the mediation procedure to its
conclusion.  The mediation shall be terminated (i) by the execution of a
settlement agreement by the parties, (ii) by a declaration of the mediator that
the mediation is terminated, or (iii) by a written declaration of a party to the
effect that the mediation process is terminated at the conclusion of one full
day's mediation session.  Even if the mediation is terminated without a
resolution of the dispute, the parties agree not to terminate negotiations and
not to commence any legal action or seek other remedies prior to the expiration
of five (5) days following the mediation.  The fees and expenses of the mediator
shall be shared equally by the parties.  The mediator shall be disqualified as a
witness, consultant, expert or counsel for any party with respect to the dispute
and any related matters.
       I.   Mediation is a compromise negotiation for purposes of the Federal
and State Rules of Evidence and constitutes privileged communication.  The
entire mediation process is confidential, and no stenographic, visual or audio
record shall be made.  All conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and
opinions, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any
party, by their agents, employees, representatives or other invitees and by the
mediator are confidential and shall, in addition and where appropriate, be
deemed to be privileged.  Such conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and
opinions shall not be discoverable or admissible for any purposes, including
impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, and
shall not be disclosed to anyone not an agent, employee, expert, witness, or
representative of any of the parties;  provided however, that evidence otherwise
discoverable or admissible is not excluded from discovery or admission as a
result of its use in the mediation.
                                          30
       J.   Nothing herein contained shall bar our right to seek and obtain
temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with applicable law against any conduct or threatened conduct by you which could
impair the goodwill associated with the Marks.
       K.   The parties (and their respective owners) agree to waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the right to or claim for any punitive or
exemplary damages against the other and agree that in the event of a dispute
between them, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained.

software, programs, know-how or other proprietary ideas or information, nor will

party or assist others in using, copying or duplicating any of the foregoing.

may be reduced to whatever extent the court deems reasonable, and such covenants
and agreements shall be enforced as to such reduced area, activity or time.  To
the extent required by the laws of the state in which the Restaurant is located,

both, shall be deemed amended in accordance with Section 2.

time to time grant to Franchisee or to any of you, including, without
limitation, the acceptance of partial payment or performance, the compromise or
release of any claims, the release of any other guarantor, or our consent to any
transfer or assignment of the franchise or any interest therein and expressly
reserve all rights that we may have against you.
            C.    TERM OF GUARANTY.  This guaranty and your obligations under it
shall continue in effect so long as you operate any Buffalo Wild Wing Restaurant
or hold any beneficial interest therein and for a one (1) year period

(1) any of us is involved in any judicial or administrative process with
Franchisee or any of you (i) to collect any amounts owed us by you, or (ii) to

that you may have against Franchisee arising as a result of your execution and
performance of this guaranty.
            E.    ASSIGNMENT.  This guaranty is personal to you and the
obligations and duties imposed in it may not be delegated or assigned; provided,
this guaranty shall be binding upon your successors, assigns, estates and
personal representatives.  This guaranty shall inure to our benefit, and the
benefit of our affiliates, successors and assigns.
            F.    ENFORCEMENT.  If any one or more provisions in this guaranty
shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any

maximum extent permitted by law that is subsumed within the terms of such
provision as though it were separately articulated herein.

                                 ADDENDUM TO LEASE
       THIS ADDENDUM TO LEASE, dated ______________, 199__, is entered into by
and between _______________________("Lessor"), and __________________________
("Lessee").
       RECITALS:
       A.   The parties hereto have entered into a certain Lease Agreement,
dated _____________, 199__, and pertaining to the premises located at _________
__________________________________ (the "Lease").
       B.   Lessor acknowledges that Lessee intends to operate a Restaurant from
the leased premises (the "Premises") pursuant to a Franchise Agreement (the
"Franchise Agreement") with bw-3 Franchise Systems, Inc. ("bw-3") under the name
"Buffalo Wild Wings" or other name designated by bw-3 ("Franchised Restaurant").
       C.   The parties now desire to amend the Lease in accordance with the
terms and conditions contained herein.
       AGREEMENT:
       NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby mutually covenanted and agreed between
Lessor and Lessee as follows:
       1.   REMODELING AND DECOR.  Lessor agrees that Lessee shall have the
right to remodel, equip, paint and decorate the interior of the Premises and to
display such proprietary marks and signs on the interior and exterior of the
Premises as Lessee is reasonably required to do pursuant to the Franchise
Agreement and any successor Franchise Agreement under which Lessee may operate a
Franchised Restaurant on the Premises.
       2.   ASSIGNMENT.  Lessee shall have the right to assign all of its right,
title and interest in the Lease to bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3 at any time
during the term of the Lease, including any extensions or renewals thereof,
without first obtaining Lessor's consent.  However, no assignment shall be
effective until such time as bw-3 or its designated affiliate gives Lessor
written notice of its acceptance of such assignment, and nothing contained
herein or in any other document shall constitute bw-3 or its designated
affiliate a party to the Lease, or  guarantor thereof, and shall not create any
liability or obligation of bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3 unless and until the
Lease is assigned to, and accepted in writing by, bw-3 or its designated
affiliate.  In the event of an assignment, Lessee shall remain liable under the
terms of the Lease.
       3.   DEFAULT AND NOTICE.
            (a)   In the event there is a default or violation by Lessee under
       the terms of the Lease, Lessor shall give Lessee and bw-3 written notice
       of such default or violation within a reasonable time after Lessor
       receives knowledge of its occurrence.  bw-3 will notify Lessor whether it
       intends to cure the default and take an automatic assignment of Lessee's
       interest as provided in Paragraph 4(a).  bw-3 will have an additional
       fifteen (15) days in which to cure the default or violation.
            (b)   All notices to bw-3 shall be sent by registered or certified
       mail, postage prepaid, to the following address:
                  bw-3 Franchise Systems, Inc.
                  1919 Interchange Tower
                  600 South Highway 169
                  Minneapolis, MN 5542639
                  Attention: Chief Financial Officer
bw-3 may change its address for receiving notices by giving Lessor written
notice of such new address.  Lessor agrees that it will notify both Lessee and
bw-3 of any change in Lessor's mailing address to which notices should be sent.
       4.   TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION.
            (a)   Upon the expiration or termination of either the Lease or the
       Franchise Agreement, bw-3 will, at its option, have the right (but not
       the requirement) to take an automatic assignment of Lessee's interest.
            (b)   Upon the expiration or termination of either the Lease or the
       Franchise Agreement, Landlord will cooperate with and assist us in
       gaining possession of premises and if bw-3 does not elect to take an
       assignment of the Lessee's interest, Lessor will allow bw-3 to enter the
       Premises, without being guilty of trespass and without incurring any
       liability to Lessor, to remove all signs, awnings, and all other items
       identifying the Premises as a Franchised Restaurant and to make such
       other modifications (such as repainting) as are reasonably necessary to
       protect the bw-3 marks and system, and to distinguish the Premises from
       Franchised Restaurants.  In the event bw-3 exercises its option to
       purchase assets of Lessee, Lessor shall permit bw-3 to remove all such
       assets being purchased by bw-3.
       5.   CONSIDERATION; NO LIABILITY.
            (a)   Lessor hereby acknowledges that the provisions of this
       Addendum to Lease are required pursuant to the Franchise Agreement under
       which Lessee plans to operate its business and the Lessee would not lease
       the Premises without this Addendum.
            (b)   Lessor further acknowledges that Lessee is not an agent or
       employee of bw-3 and the Lessee has no authority or power to act for, or
       to create any liability on behalf of, or to in any way bind bw-3 or any
       affiliate of bw-3, and that Lessor has entered into this Addendum to
       Lease with full understanding that it creates no duties, obligations or
       liabilities of or against bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3.
       6.   SALES REPORTS.  If requested by bw-3, Lessor will provide bw-3 with
whatever information Lessor has regarding Lessee's sales from the Restaurant.
       7.   AMENDMENTS.  No amendment or variation of the terms of this Addendum
to the Lease shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties
hereto.
       8.   REAFFIRMATION OF LEASE.  Except as amended or modified herein, all
of the terms, conditions and covenants of the Lease shall remain in full force
and effect and are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof as
though copied herein in full.
       9.   BENEFICIARY.  Lessor and Lessee expressly agree that bw-3 is a third
party beneficiary of this Addendum.
                                          40
       IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, witness the signatures of the parties hereto as of
the day, month and year first written above.

overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Interest shall
accrue from the original due date until payment is received in full. Our right to such interest shall be in addition to any other remedies we may
have, including, without limitation, the right of set-off to withdraw or retain, from time to time and without notice to you, any amounts due and
unpaid by us to you. You shall not be entitled to set-off any payments required to be made under this Section 4 against any monetary claim you

11.4.1 You shall promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates. In the event of termination for any default of yours, such

determining what costs, if any, we might have saved and how much the Royalty Fees would have grown over what would have been this
Agreement’s remaining term. The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those
damages.
 
11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does

provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision

without opportunity to cure pursuant to Section 10.2.3 of this Agreement.
 
12.3 Granting of a Security Interest by You

obtaining our prior written consent. Our consent or refusal to consent may be based upon whatever factors we, in our sole discretion, deem
economically and commercially reasonable in protecting our interests and security interest under this Agreement and the relationship created
under this Agreement; however, if you are in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements between us or our affiliates and you,
we shall, upon your written request, execute a written subordination of our security interest to lenders and/or lessors providing financing for the
Franchised Business. Under any circumstances however, we shall not consent to any such granting of a security interest unless all of the
following conditions are met:
 
12.3.1 Such security is granted only for the purpose of securing a loan in your favor, which loan shall only be for the benefit of
the Franchised Business.
 
12.3.2 In the event of any default by you under any documents in any way relating to the security interest or the loan to which
it relates, we shall have the right at our sole option (but not the obligation) to cure any such default and/or to be substituted as obligor to the
lender whose interests are secured by such security interest.
 
12.3.3 In the event of any such default, and if we choose to be substituted as obligor, we shall be so substituted in all respects
on the same terms and conditions to which you were subject, except that any acceleration of the obligations secured, due to your default, shall
be void upon cure by us.
 
12.3.4 Such other conditions and terms as we shall deem necessary and/or prudent to protect our interests under this
Agreement.
 
12.4 Transfer Upon Death or Disability
 
Upon the death or permanent disability (mental or physical) of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or
substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person shall transfer
such interest to a third party approved by us within twelve (12) months after such death or disability. Such transfers, including, without
limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any  inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall
be waived. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, however, if the heirs or beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the
conditions of this Section 12, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the decedent shall transfer the decedent’s interest to
another party approved by us within twelve (12) months, which disposition shall be subject to all the terms and conditions for transfers
contained in this Agreement. We may, at our option, assume management and control of the Franchised Business during such twelve (12) month
period and shall be paid a reasonable monthly management fee for our services as determined by us. If the interest is not disposed of within
such period, we may, at our option, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2.4 of this Agreement.

waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement by the transferor or transferee.

retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense.
Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.

contemporaneously with this Agreement, constitute the entire and complete Agreement between us (and, if applicable, any affiliate) and you
concerning the subject matter thereof, and supersede all prior agreements. You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement, and any
ancillary agreements executed contemporaneously herewith, as a result of your own independent investigation of the business franchised
hereby and not as a result of any representation made by us or persons associated with us, or other franchisees, which are contrary to the terms
herein set forth or which are contrary to the terms of any Franchise Disclosure Document or other similar document required or permitted to be
given to you pursuant to applicable law. Except for those permitted under this Agreement to be made unilaterally by us, no amendment, change,

considered severable; and if, for any reason, any section, paragraph, part, term, provision, and/or covenant herein is determined to be invalid
and contrary to, or in conflict with, any existing or future law or regulation by a court or agency having valid jurisdiction, such shall not impair
the operation of, or have any other effect upon, such other portions, sections, paragraphs, parts, terms, provisions, and/or covenants of this
Agreement as may remain otherwise intelligible; and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties hereto; and the
invalid portions, sections, paragraphs, parts, terms, provisions, and/or covenants shall be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement. Neither
this Agreement or any uncertainty or ambiguity in this Agreement shall be construed or resolved against the drafter of this Agreement, whether
under any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this Agreement has been review by all parties and shall be construed and
interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used to fairly accomplish the purposes and intentions of all parties to this
Agreement. We and you intend that if any provision of this Agreement is susceptible to two or more constructions, one of which would render
the provision enforceable and the other or others of which would render the provision unenforceable, the provision shall be given the meaning
that renders it enforceable.
