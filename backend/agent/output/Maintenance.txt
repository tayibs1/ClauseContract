RESTATED  
NET INVESTMENT INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT  
SECURIAN FUNDS TRUST  
RESTATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT, effective as of May 1, 2012, by and between Advantus Capital Management, Inc. (the “Investment Adviser”), Securian Financial Services, Inc. (the “Underwriter”) and Securian Funds Trust (the “Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust, on behalf of the Trust’s Advantus Money Market Fund (the “Fund”).  
WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization approved by both the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Board of Directors of Advantus Series Fund, Inc. (the “Series Fund”) on July 28, 2011, and approved by a majority of the shareholders of each Portfolio of the Series Fund on October 21, 2011, each Portfolio of the Series Fund was reorganized into a separate Fund of the Trust effective as of May 1, 2012; and  
WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser, the Underwriter and the Series Fund have previously entered into a Net Investment Income Maintenance Agreement, effective as of February 1, 2009 and an Amended and Restated Net Investment Income Maintenance Agreement effective as of October 29, 2009 (the “Prior Agreements”); and  
WHEREAS, the parties have determined that each desires to restate and adopt the Prior Agreements as set forth herein; and  
WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as an open-end management company of the series type, and the Fund is a series of the Trust; and  
WHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the “Advisory Agreement”), pursuant to which the Investment Adviser will render investment advisory services to the Fund for compensation based on the value of the average daily net assets of the Fund; and  
WHEREAS, the Trust and the Underwriter have entered into an Underwriting and Distribution Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the “Underwriting Agreement”) pursuant to which the Underwriter acts the principal underwriter for the Fund, and receives compensation thereunder pursuant to the Fund’s Rule 12b-1 Plan; and  
WHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have determined that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders to maintain the Fund’s daily “Net Investment Income” (as defined in paragraph 1.1 below) at or in excess of zero.NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  2  
1. Net Investment Income Maintenance. 
 
1.1 Net Investment Income. “Fund Investment Income”, as defined in paragraph 1.2 below, minus “Fund Operating Expenses” as defined in paragraph 1.3 below equals Net Investment Income. If the Fund’s Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment Adviser shall waive its Advisory Fee or reimburse the Fund an amount (defined as “Expense Waiver”) sufficient to produce a Net Investment Income of zero. 
 
1.2 Fund Investment Income. Fund Investment Income includes interest and dividends, net of foreign withholding taxes, plus income from securities lending activities, if applicable. Fund Investment Income does not include realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments and foreign currencies. 
 
1.3 Fund Operating Expenses. Fund Operating Expenses are the aggregate expenses of every character incurred by the Fund, including but not limited to investment advisory fees of the Investment Adviser (but excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and other expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund’s business). Fund Operating Expenses do not include “acquired fund fees and expenses” as defined in SEC Form N-1A, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 
1.4 Method of Computing Expense Waiver. To determine the Expense Waiver (Investment Adviser’s liability), each day the Fund Operating Expenses shall be subtracted from the Fund Investment Income to produce the daily Net Investment Income. If the daily Net Investment Income is below zero for any day, the Investment Adviser shall first waive or reduce its advisory fee for such day by an amount sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero. If the amount of the waived or reduced advisory fee for any such day is insufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero , the Investment Adviser shall also pay Fund expenses or reimburse the Fund an amount that, together with the waived or reduced advisory fee, is sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero. 
 
1.5 Right of Recovery. The Investment Adviser shall have the option to recover the full amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense Waiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund’s Net Investment Income exceeds zero. In no event, however, shall the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day unless the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable. If, and to the extent, the payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser of the Expense Waiver would cause the Fund’s Net Investment Income to fall below zero, such payment shall be deferred until such date on which theIn connection with the obligation of the Investment Adviser to maintain the Fund’s Net Investment Income as set forth in section 1 herein, the Underwriter may waive its Rule 12b-1 fees contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, and shall have the same rights to be reimbursed by the Fund as the Investment Adviser, as set forth in Section 1 herein, to the extent the Investment Adviser has not already been reimbursed by the Fund for its payment of Rule 12b-1 fees.    
This Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of one year from the date of its execution and from year to year thereafter provided such continuance is specifically approved by a majority of the trustees of the Trust who (i) are not “interested persons” of the Trust or any other party to this Agreement, as defined in the 1940 Act, and (ii) have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of this Agreement (“Non-Interested Trustees”). This Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement except the Investment Adviser’s Right of Recovery set forth in section 1.5 herein.    
  
  3  
 
payment would not cause the Fund to have a Net Investment Income of less than zero, provided that the right of the Investment Adviser to receive such payment shall expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement. For purposes of this paragraph 1.5 (and for purposes of paragraph 2), the Expense Waiver that may be recovered from the Fund shall include the amount of any unrecovered Expense Waiver under the Prior Agreements, provided that the Investment Adviser’s right to receive such payment shall also expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement. 
 
1.6 Payment. If the Investment Adviser is required to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end in the amount due the Fund as of each month. If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end. Reimbursements to the Fund or the Expense Waiver shall not include any additional charges or fees whatsoever, including, e.g., interest accruable on such reimbursements or the Expense Waiver. 
  1.7 Operating Expense Limit. Any Expense Waiver recovery payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser shall not cause the Operating Expense for the Fund’s full year of operations to exceed 1.25% of the Fund’s average daily net assets. 
2. The Underwriter.

8
Source: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019(b) Permitting Delays. Vendor shall timely, diligently and continuously pursue and use reasonable best efforts to
obtain as soon as possible any Permits required to be obtained in connection with or in order to perform the
Work and otherwise fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, the Build Addendum and/or the Maintenance
Addendum, including without limitation requesting assistance from AT&T as appropriate. Upon Vendor’s
reasonable request for AT&T’s assistance in obtaining any such Permit, the Parties agree to cooperate in good
faith to obtain such Permit. To the extent that Vendor (x) has timely notified AT&T of related Delay
Information contemplated in Subsection (a) above, (y) has complied with this Section 3.3(b) and (z) is
nevertheless unable to obtain or delayed in obtaining a required Permit which is reasonably likely to result in
Vendor missing a Delivery Date or Completion Date (a “Permitting Delay”), then the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to extend such Delivery Date or Completion Date and such Permitting Delay shall constitute an
Excusable Delay; provided, however that if the Parties cannot agree on a new Delivery Date or Completion
Date or in the event of a Permitting Delay preventing or delaying Vendor’s performance which AT&T
determines is reasonably likely to cause a material delay of the ultimate Delivery Date or Completion Date
applicable to a Cell Site, AT&T may elect to, after consultation with Vendor and good faith discussion to
negotiate another resolution:
(i) terminate its obligations solely with respect to each Cell Site affected by or related to such Permitting Delay
under this Agreement and exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum,
without liability to Vendor; provided that AT&T shall pay to Vendor, an amount equal to the demonstrated
costs incurred by Vendor for any Work completed (in accordance with applicable Specifications and
requirements) to the extent such Work is transferred to AT&T as of the effective time of termination of the
applicable terminated Cell Site, which amount shall not exceed $[***]; or
(ii) suspend this Agreement or any part hereof for the duration of such Permitting Delay (as such period is
reasonably determined by AT&T) solely with respect to any Cell Site affected by or related to such
Permitting Delay, obtain Work elsewhere (including AT&T’s performance of the Work itself), at AT&T’s
cost and expense (which shall reduce the Structured Payments applicable to such Cell Site by such
amount, but in no event shall such reduction cause the Structured Payments to be less than an amount
equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor up to the date of suspension), and provide notice to
Vendor when AT&T desires for Vendor to resume its performance under this Agreement for the remaining
Work at such Cell Site.
(c) Actual Delays. Except in the case of an Excusable Delay and subject to any applicable cure period, in the
event of any actual delay reasonably attributable to Vendor that causes Vendor to miss a Delivery Date or
Completion Date, Vendor will provide written notice to AT&T and if the condition remains uncured after the
expiration of any applicable cure period set forth in this Agreement, the Build Addendum and/or the
Maintenance Addendum, AT&T may exercise any remedies available to AT&T under this Agreement, the
Build Addendum and/or the Maintenance Addendum, as applicable.

the Party giving such consent); provided, however, that without the consent of Vendor, AT&T may assign its
rights, or delegate its duties, or both, in whole or in part, to any present or future Affiliate of AT&T so long as
AT&T Mobility LLC shall remain liable for such Affiliate’s failure to satisfy its obligations hereunder.
(b) Each Party may assign its rights under the Agreement, but any assignment of rights will be void to the extent
that (i) the assignment purports to impose upon the non-assigning Party additional costs or obligations or
requires AT&T to make payments to any Person other than Vendor, (ii) the assignment purports to preclude
AT&T from dealing solely and directly with Vendor in all matters pertaining to this Agreement, including with
respect to payments of Structured Payments and Maintenance Fees or (iii) the assignee is a Restricted Entity.
(c) Subject to Section 3.5(b), in the event that Vendor, prior to Location Acceptance at all Cell Sites and without
the prior written consent of AT&T, consummates (i) any sale, assignment, transfer, license, lease or
conveyance of any interest in any Cell Site or any of the Material or Services contemplated in this Agreement
or (ii) any Change of Control of Vendor to a Restricted Entity or to any other Person who, in AT&T’s
reasonable discretion, lacks the financial or operational resources, skill or expertise to fulfill the obligations of
Vendor contemplated by this Agreement, then AT&T may terminate this Agreement and exercise any other
remedies available to AT&T under this Agreement or at law or equity, including any of its Termination
Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum. If, following Location Acceptance of all Cell Sites, Vendor
consummates any Change of Control of Vendor to any Restricted Entity without the prior written consent of
AT&T, then AT&T shall have the right, in its sole

this Agreement. Vendor shall create and maintain any necessary records and provide any certificate,
affidavit or other information or documentation requested or as otherwise required by AT&T: (a) to show
compliance by Vendor and its Subcontractors with Laws, (b) to comply or otherwise establish AT&T’s
compliance with Laws or (c) to allow AT&T to timely respond to any complaints, filings, or other
proceedings.
3.7 Conflict of Interest . Vendor represents and warrants that, to its knowledge, no officer, director,
employee or agent of AT&T has been or will be employed, retained or paid a fee, or otherwise has
received or will receive, any personal compensation or consideration, by or from Vendor or any of
Vendor’s officers, directors, employees or agents in connection with the obtaining, arranging or
negotiation of this Agreement or other documents entered into or executed in connection with this
Agreement.
Vendor shall not offer or give gratuities in the form of gifts, entertainment, concessions, or otherwise to
AT&T or its employees or representative(s), or any person related by blood or marriage to such
individuals for the express or implied purpose of obtaining or securing favorable treatment with respect to

or other entity with which Vendor may have had any dealings.
3.8 Construction and Interpretation
(a) This Agreement has been prepared jointly and has been the subject of arm’s length and careful negotiation.
Each Party has been given the opportunity to independently review this Agreement with legal counsel and

not to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The word “include” in every form means to
include without limitation by virtue of enumeration and a derivative of a defined term shall have the meaning
appropriate to the context of its use. Whenever this Agreement refers to a consent or approval to be given by
either Party, unless such consent is expressly required to be given in writing and signed by the Party giving
approval or consent, then such consent or approval is effective if given in an email from the individuals
identified in Section 3.26 or designated by Vendor as its Project Manager pursuant to Section 18 of the Build
Addendum. The Parties agree that time is of the essence with respect to AT&T’s approval rights pursuant to
this Agreement and the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum and Vendor is relying on the timeliness
of such approvals or consents as set forth herein in order to complete the Services. The use of singular words
includes the plural and vice versa.
3.9 Cumulative Remedies. The rights and remedies of the Parties set forth in this Agreement are not
exclusive of, but are cumulative to, any rights or remedies now or subsequently existing at law, in equity,
by statute or otherwise, except in those cases where this Agreement specifies that a particular remedy is
sole or exclusive, but neither Party may retain the benefit of inconsistent remedies. No single or partial
exercise of any right or remedy with respect to one breach of this Agreement precludes the simultaneous
or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy with respect to the same or a different breach.
3.10 Delivery, Performance and Acceptance
(a) Vendor acknowledges that AT&T is responsible for the deployment of the FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety
Broadband Network (the “NPSBN”) in accordance with the terms of AT&T’s agreement with the FirstNet
Authority and that AT&T has provided certain terms of such agreement to Vendor but has not provided
Vendor with a copy of such agreement with the FirstNet Authority. Therefore, Vendor understands generally
that AT&T’s business requires prompt Delivery of Material and provision of Services by the specified Delivery
Dates. Furthermore, the Parties agree that dates for Delivery of Material and Services are firm subject to any
Excusable Delay, time is of the essence, and, subject to any Excusable Delay, Vendor will complete such
Delivery in strict conformance with the Specifications.
(b) Vendor shall perform or cause to be performed testing sufficient to ensure that all of the Material and
Deliverables perform in accordance with the Specifications, including all of the Cell Site optimization and
testing contemplated by the Build Addendum. If testing indicates that any of the Cell Sites (or any of the
Material or Deliverables relating thereto) does not conform to the Specifications, then Vendor shall notify
AT&T, in writing, of such non- conformance promptly following Vendor’s knowledge of such non-
conformance. AT&T will advise Vendor whether Vendor should Deliver the non-conforming Cell Site or any
of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto. In the event AT&T and Vendor agree in a signed writing to
Deliver non-conforming Cell Sites or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto (“Provisional
Location Acceptance”), Vendor shall use all commercially reasonable efforts promptly to cure any such non-
conformance after Provisional Location Acceptance of

respect to the Cell Site within nine (9) months following Provisional Location Acceptance (or sixty (60) days if
the non-conformance is caused by the existence of a Lien, and in each case subject to an Excusable Delay),
then AT&T may elect in its sole discretion, to complete any outstanding work, and recoup any costs by an
offset against the Maintenance Fees due to Vendor for all Cell Sites. If such non-conforming Cell Site has not
been cured within such nine (9) month cure period (or 60-day cure period in the case of a Lien), AT&T shall
have no further obligation to pay any Maintenance Fees to Vendor with respect to such non-conforming Cell
Site until the non-conformance has been cured. Provisional Location Acceptance of any such non-conforming
Cell Site or receipt of any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto shall not constitute Location
Acceptance and shall not constitute a waiver of any of AT&T’s rights, warranties, or remedies under this
Agreement or elsewhere, including Termination Remedies under the Build Addendum. Location Acceptance
of any such non-conforming Cell Site shall not occur until all non-conformance has been cured; provided, that
AT&T shall begin making Structured Payments for such Cell Site upon Provisional Location Acceptance in the
same manner as if it were Location Acceptance.
(c) In no event shall Location Acceptance be deemed to occur absent a signed writing from AT&T prior to the
date Vendor completes its Delivery of all Material and Services in accordance with the Specifications related
to the Cell Site as required by the Build Addendum.
(d) If AT&T advises Vendor of, or Vendor becomes aware of a landlord complaint, Vendor shall, if necessary,
promptly respond to the landlord complaint, shall commence any agreed upon corrections promptly, and shall
diligently pursue the same until completion.
(e) In addition to the provisions set forth in this Section, AT&T shall be able to exercise any or all remedies
available to it under the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum.
3.11 Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise expressly referenced herein, including the matters set
forth in the Transport Agreement and the Master License Agreement, this Agreement and all addendums,
appendices, exhibits, attachments, schedules and documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes
the final, complete, and exclusive expression of the Parties’ agreement on the matters contained in this
Agreement. The terms of this Agreement shall govern in lieu of all other pre-printed, standardized or other
provisions that may otherwise appear in any other paper or electronic record of either Party (such as
standard terms on order or acknowledgment forms, advance shipping notices, invoices, time sheets, and
packages, shrink wrap terms, and click wrap terms). Except to the extent set forth in the Transport
Agreement and the Master License Agreement, all prior written and oral negotiations and agreements, and
all contemporaneous oral negotiations and agreements, between the Parties on the matters contained in
this Agreement are expressly merged into and superseded by this Agreement. The Parties do not intend
that the provisions of this Agreement be explained, supplemented, or qualified through evidence of trade
usage or any prior course of dealings or any course of performance under any prior agreement. In entering
into this Agreement, neither Party has relied upon any statement, estimate, forecast, projection,
representation, warranty, action or agreement of the other Party except for those expressly contained in

3.12 Force Majeure
(a) Except for AT&T’s obligations to make the Structured Payments and pay the Maintenance Fees, a Party is
excused from performing its obligations under this Agreement only if, to the extent that, and for so long as such
Party’s performance is actually prevented or delayed by acts of God or the public enemy, acts of civil or
military authority, terrorists acts, embargoes, epidemics, war, riots, insurrections, fires, explosions,
earthquakes, floods, and weather events that are beyond its reasonable control and could not have been
prevented or avoided by its exercise of due diligence and such Party gives written notice to the other Party, as
soon as practicable under the circumstances, of the act or event that so prevents such Party from performing
its obligations (each, a “Force Majeure Event”). After Vendor provides written notice to AT&T of any Force
Majeure Event in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Parties shall extend the applicable Delivery
Date or Completion Date for the length of such Force Majeure Event and, subject to Subsection (b) below,
such Force Majeure Event shall be an Excusable Delay.
(b) If Vendor is the Party whose performance is prevented or delayed by a Force Majeure Event and AT&T
determines that the Force Majeure Event is reasonably likely to cause a material delay of the ultimate Delivery
Date or Completion Date for any Cell Site, then AT&T may elect to, after consultation with Vendor and good
faith discussion to negotiate another resolution:
(i) terminate its obligations with respect to each Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event
under this Agreement and exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, in
each case without liability to Vendor; provided that AT&T shall pay to Vendor, an amount equal to
demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor for any Work completed (in accordance with applicable
Specifications and requirements) to the extent such Work is transferable to and usable by AT&T as of the
effective time of termination of the applicable terminated Cell Site, which amount shall not exceed $[***];
or
(ii) suspend this Agreement or any part hereof for the duration of such Force Majeure Event solely with
respect to any Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event, obtain Work elsewhere
(including AT&T’s performance of the Work itself), at AT&T’s cost and expense (which shall reduce the
Structured Payments applicable to such Cell Site by such amount, but in no event shall such reduction
cause the Structured Payments to be less than an amount equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by
Vendor up to the date of suspension), and provide notice to Vendor when AT&T desires for Vendor to
resume its performance under this Agreement for the remaining Work at such Cell Site.
3.13 Government Contract Provisions and Flow Downs

Vendor’s performance as specifically required by that certain contract awarded to an Affiliate of AT&T by the
FirstNet Authority regarding the FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (the “ FirstNet
Agreement”) and such Government Flow Downs and Contract Clauses that may be applicable are attached
to this Agreement as Exhibit A, the terms of which are hereby fully incorporated into the Agreement.
3.14 Governing Law. The laws of the State of New York (excluding any laws that direct the application of
another jurisdiction’s law) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the
transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and
enforcement.
3.15 Indemnity
(a) Except for Covered Losses that are exclusively provided for in the Section entitled “Infringement,”
Vendor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties, in accordance
with this Section, against any Third Party Loss arising from, or in connection with, or resulting from,
(i) any default, violation, breach or nonperformance by Vendor or any Vendor Person of Vendor’s
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement, the Build Addendum
or the Maintenance Addendum, (ii) the Deliverables, Material or Services furnished by Vendor or
any Vendor Person and the use, construction, maintenance, operation or occupancy of any Cell Site
by Vendor or any Vendor Person, (iii) the negligent or willful acts or omissions of Vendor and each
Vendor Person with respect to this Agreement or (iv) Employment Claims. Subject to AT&T’s
obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) or (d) below, respectively,
Vendor’s duty to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties against any
Third Party Loss extends to any Third Party Loss that may be caused or alleged to be caused in
part by the negligence of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent that such
indemnification is permitted by applicable Law.
(b) AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor in writing of any claim, demand, suit, cause of action or legal
proceeding that may give rise to a claim against Vendor for defense and indemnification under this
Section 3.15. If AT&T fails to give notice, Vendor is still obligated to indemnify, hold harmless and
defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties, except that Vendor is not liable for any Litigation Expense
that AT&T incurs before the time when notice is given or for any Loss or Liability to the extent that
Vendor can show that such delay or failure to provide notice actually and materially prejudiced it in
defending against such Loss or Liability.
(c) Vendor shall conduct the defense (employing one or more competent attorneys from a nationally
recognized law firm), at Vendor’s expense, against any claim, demand, suit or cause of action within
the scope of Subsection (a) above, whether or not litigation is actually commenced or the
allegations are meritorious and, upon AT&T’s request, keep AT&T informed as to the progress of
such defense. At its own option and expense, AT&T may employ separate counsel, including in-
house counsel, to conduct the AT&T

of any such claim. Vendor may control the defense and settlement of such a claim, but if the
settlement of a claim may have an adverse effect on any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, then
Vendor shall not settle such claim without the consent of AT&T, and AT&T shall not unreasonably
withhold, condition or delay its consent. To the extent that Vendor pays any part of a judgment,
award or settlement with respect to the Third Party Loss and any other expenses related to the
resolution of the Third Party Loss, including costs, interest, and Attorneys’ Fees, as a result of
being self-insured (including any deductible) or as a result of insurance coverage being insufficient
to cover the amount of the judgment, award or settlement, upon final resolution of the claim,
demand, suit or cause of action, AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for the pro-rata portion of any such
payment based on the AT&T Indemnified Parties’ fault relative to Vendor’s fault.
(d) In addition to AT&T’s obligation to reimburse Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) above, AT&T
shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Vendor Indemnified Parties against any Third Party
Loss arising solely from or in connection with, resulting solely from, or relating solely to (i) the
AT&T Provided Equipment furnished by AT&T or (ii) the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts or
omissions of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties under this Agreement; in each case in the same
manner as set forth in Subsection (b) and in the first four sentences of Subsection (c), with the
appropriate changes having been made.
(e) Subject to AT&T’s obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) and (d)
above, respectively, Vendor shall bring no claim or action for indemnification, contribution, or
subrogation against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties nor shall Vendor implead any of them in
any action brought by another, based on injury to the person or death arising out or relating to
Vendor’s performance under this Agreement. If, through any such action, Vendor ever acquires a
Lien on a judgment against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, then Vendor shall assign such
Lien to AT&T. Vendor waives any immunity from indemnification (only with respect to the AT&T
Indemnified Parties) that Vendor may hold, by virtue of Vendor’s compliance with its workers’
compensation obligations in any jurisdiction, even if such immunity arises under the constitution or
statutes of such jurisdiction.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, the Parties intend that any
amount for which any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties might otherwise have an obligation of
reimbursement to Vendor for its pro-rata portion pursuant to this Section will be net of any
insurance proceeds or other amounts paid by Vendor’s insurance company (“Insurance Proceeds”)
that actually reduce the amount that Vendor is required to pay on account of a Third Party Loss.
Accordingly, the amount with respect to which AT&T is required to reimburse Vendor its pro-rata
portion will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually paid on behalf of Vendor in
respect of the related Third Party Loss. If Vendor receives a reimbursement required by this
Section from AT&T in respect of the AT&T Indemnified Parties’ pro-rata share

of any payments made for Vendor or on its behalf by any insurance company or other entity with
respect to such Third Party Loss, then Vendor will pay to AT&T, within fifteen (15) days after such
receipt of Insurance Proceeds or benefit of any payments, an amount equal to the excess of the
reimbursement that Vendor received from AT&T over the amount of the reimbursement that would
have been due under this Section from AT&T if the Insurance Proceeds had been received, realized
or recovered before the reimbursement was made by AT&T. An insurer that would otherwise be
obligated to pay any amount as a result of a Third Party Loss shall not be relieved of the
responsibility with respect thereto or, by virtue of the indemnification or reimbursement provisions
hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed
that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to a “wind-fall” (i.e., a benefit they would
not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the
indemnification or reimbursement provisions hereof. Vendor shall have a good faith obligation to
seek, and AT&T shall provide its reasonable cooperation to Vendor in its efforts, to collect or
recover any Insurance Proceeds that may in any way be available to reduce the amount of any
Third Party Loss.
3.16 Information
(a) In connection with this Agreement, including Vendor’s performance of its obligations hereunder and AT&T’s
receipt of Work, either Party may find it beneficial to disclose to the other Party (which may include permitting
or enabling the other Party’s access to) certain of its Information. For the purpose of this clause, AT&T’s
disclosure of Information to Vendor includes any Information that Vendor receives, observes, collects, stores,
or accesses, in any way, in connection with this Agreement and all such Information disclosed by AT&T
hereunder shall be and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of AT&T. Information of a disclosing Party
shall be deemed to be confidential or proprietary only if it is clearly marked or otherwise identified by the
disclosing Party as being confidential or proprietary, provided that if it is orally or visually disclosed (including
Information conveyed to an answering machine, voice mail box or similar medium), the disclosing Party shall
designate it as confidential or proprietary at the time of such disclosure, however, failure to do so shall not
prevent such Information from receiving the protections afforded to it in this Section 3.16. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a disclosing Party shall not have any such obligation to so mark or identify, or to so designate,
Information that the disclosing Party discloses to or is otherwise obtained by the other Party’s employees,
contractors, or representatives (i) who are located on the disclosing Party’s premises; (ii) who access the
disclosing Party’s systems; or (iii) who otherwise obtain AT&T Information and/or AT&T Customer
Information in connection with this Agreement; any such Information so disclosed shall automatically be
deemed to be confidential and proprietary. Additionally, the failure to mark or designate information as being
confidential or proprietary will not waive the confidentiality where it is reasonably obvious, under the
circumstances surrounding disclosure, that the Information is confidential or proprietary; any such Information
so disclosed or obtained shall automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. For greater
certainty, Information provided by either Party to the other Party prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement

Party shall disclose Information under this Agreement that includes, in any form, any of the following: customer
or employee personal information, credit card and credit related information, health or financial information,
and/or authentication credentials, without the express consent of the disclosing Party, which consent shall be in
writing and signed by the disclosing party.
(b) With respect to the Information of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall:
(i) hold all such Information in confidence with the same degree of care with which it protects its own
confidential or proprietary Information, but with no less than reasonably prudent care;
(ii) restrict disclosure of such Information solely to its and its Affiliates’ employees, contractors, directors,
advisors, financing sources and agents with a need to know such Information, advise such persons of
their confidentiality obligations with respect thereto, and ensure that such persons are bound by
obligations of confidentiality reasonably comparable to those imposed in this Agreement;
(iii) use such Information only as needed to perform its obligations (and, if AT&T is the receiving Party, to
receive the benefits of the Work provided) under this Agreement;
(iv) except as necessary under the immediately preceding Subsection (iii), not copy, distribute, or otherwise
use any such Information or allow anyone else to copy, distribute, or otherwise use such Information;
and ensure that any and all copies bear the same notices or legends, if any, as the originals; and
(v) upon the disclosing Party’s request, promptly return, or destroy all or any requested portion of the
Information, including tangible and electronic copies, notes, summaries, extracts, mail or other
communications, and provide written certification within fifteen (15) business days to the disclosing
Party that such Information has been returned or destroyed; provided, however, that (i) the receiving
Party may retain copies of such documents and other tangible embodiments of Information as required
by applicable Law to which the receiving Party is subject and (ii) the receiving Party shall have no
obligation to destroy or delete electronic copies of, or material containing, Information that are
automatically generated through data backup and/or archiving systems and that are not readily
accessible by the receiving Party’s business personnel. Notwithstanding the expiration or termination of
this Agreement or any return or destruction of Information, all Information, including without limitation
that as may be retained in accordance with the above-referenced exceptions, will continue to be subject
to the provisions of this Section 3.16 for so long as such Information remains in the custody or control
of the receiving Party.

Information which:

confidential (as evidenced by the receiving Party’s written records prepared prior to such disclosure);
(ii) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the receiving Party (such obligations ceasing at
the time such Information becomes publicly known);

written records, and where such development occurred without any direct or indirect use of or access
to the Information received from the disclosing Party, or

(d) If a receiving Party is required to provide Information of a disclosing Party to any court or government agency
pursuant to a written court order, subpoena, regulatory demand, request under the National Labor Relations
Act (an “NLRA Request”), or process of law, the receiving Party must, unless prohibited by applicable Law,
first provide the disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement and reasonable cooperation
to the disclosing Party should it seek protective arrangements for the production of such Information. The
receiving Party will (i) take reasonable steps to limit any such provision of Information to the specific
Information required by such court or agency, and (ii) continue to otherwise protect all Information disclosed
in response to such order, subpoena, regulation, NLRA Request, or process of law.

effect and survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years thereafter.

3.17 Infringement
(a) Definitions. For purposes of this Section:
(i) “Infringement Loss” shall mean any Liability, loss, claim, demand, suit, cause of action, settlement payment,
cost, expense, interest, award, judgment, damages (including punitive and exemplary damages and
increased damages for willful infringement), Liens, fines, fees, penalties, and Litigation Expense.
(ii) “Provided Elements” shall mean any Material, Services or Deliverables or other products, hardware,
software, interfaces, systems, content, services, processes, methods, documents, materials, data or
information, or any functionality therein, provided to any AT&T Indemnified Party by or on behalf of
Vendor (including by any of Vendor’s Subcontractors or distributors or any Vendor Person) pursuant to
this Agreement (including under any addendum, order, statement of work, exhibit, schedule or other
document under, subordinate to, or referencing this Agreement); provided, however, that Provided
Elements shall not include any AT&T Provided Equipment.
(b) Obligations.
(i) Vendor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend (which shall include cooperating with AT&T as set forth
below in the defense of) each of the AT&T Indemnified Parties against any Infringement Loss or other
Liability resulting from, arising out of or relating to any allegation, threat, demand, claim or lawsuit
brought by any third party ( “Covered Claim”), regardless of whether such Covered Claim is
meritorious, of:
1. infringement (including direct, contributory and induced infringement) of any patent, copyright,
trademark, service mark, or other Intellectual Property Right in connection with the Provided
Elements, including any Covered Claim of infringement based on:
A. making, repair, receipt, use, importing, sale or disposal (and offers to do any of the foregoing) of
Provided Elements (or having others do any of the foregoing, in whole or in part, on behalf of or
at the direction of the AT&T Indemnified Parties), or
B. use of Provided Elements in combination with products, hardware, software, interfaces, systems,
content, services, processes, methods, documents, materials, data or information not furnished
by Vendor, including use in the form of the making, having made or using of an apparatus or
system, or the making or practicing of a process or method unless the function performed by the
Provided Elements in such combination is of a type that is neither normal nor reasonably
anticipated for such Provided Elements (a “Combination Claim”);

Provided Elements;
any and all such Infringement Loss or other Liabilities referenced in this Subsection (b)(i) being
hereinafter referred to as a “Covered Loss.”
(ii) Insofar as Vendor’s obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a Covered
Claim that is a Combination Claim, Vendor shall be liable to pay only its Proportionate Share of the
Covered Loss associated with such Combination Claim. The “Proportionate Share” payable by Vendor
shall be a portion of the Covered Loss determined, not at AT&T’s sole discretion, but rather on an
objectively fair and equitable basis (taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances and using
the same standards that would be applied by a court or other neutral adjudicator under applicable Law)
to be attributable to Vendor based on the relative materiality of the role played by the applicable
Provided Elements in the Combination Claim. If Vendor believes AT&T’s assessment of Vendor’s
Proportionate Share is not fair and equitable, then Vendor’s Proportionate Share shall be determined,
insofar as possible, through good faith negotiation between the Parties; provided, however, that a failure
of the Parties to agree on Vendor’s Proportionate Share shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations to pay
its Proportionate Share under this Section. Vendor shall make payments in satisfaction of its
Proportionate Share obligation whenever such payments become due. In no event shall Vendor be
liable, with regard to a Combination Claim, for more than its Proportionate Share. If the Parties cannot
mutually agree on Vendor’s Proportionate Share within sixty (60) days of AT&T’s providing Vendor
with AT&T’s assessment of Vendor’s Proportionate Share, either Party may notify the other Party that a
dispute has occurred, at which point the Parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
Section 4.8 (“Dispute Resolution”), provided that in preparation for the escalation set forth in Section
4.8(a), Vendor shall notify AT&T in writing of the percentage which Vendor believes, in good faith,
constitutes Vendor’s Proportionate Share (“Vendor’s Minimum Share”). If arbitration is invoked under
Section 4.8(b), all arbitrators shall be qualified by education, training, and experience in both the
intellectual property law (e.g., patent law) and the technology relevant to any dispute under this Section.
Throughout the course of attempting to resolve the dispute, Vendor shall continue to pay Vendor’s
Minimum Share to AT&T as such payments become due. When Vendor’s Proportionate Share is finally
determined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) (“Determined Proportionate
Share”), there shall be a true-up and Vendor shall promptly pay to AT&T the aggregate amount of past
underpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the Determined
Proportionate Share, minus those amounts that Vendor had actually paid to AT&T), if any. Thereafter,
Vendor shall promptly pay its Determined Proportionate Share. (In the event that the Determined
Proportionate Share is less than the Vendor’s Minimum Share, AT&T shall refund to Vendor any past
overpayments.) In no event shall AT&T’s acceptance of payments computed at Vendor’s Minimum
Share prejudice or waive any of AT&T’s rights under this Agreement.

Claim that involves Vendor and one or more other suppliers of AT&T or its Affiliates ((1) and (2) being
hereinafter referred to separately and collectively as a “Compound Claim”). Vendor shall cooperate
with AT&T to facilitate the defense and may, at its option and at its own expense, participate with
AT&T in the defense with counsel of its own choosing. Where AT&T controls the defense under this
Subsection (b)(iii), AT&T shall make good faith efforts to enter into a reasonable joint defense or
common interest agreement with Vendor.
(iv) Insofar as Vendor’s obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a Covered
Claim other than a Compound Claim, Vendor shall have the discretion, but not the obligation, to control
the defense of the Covered Claim. In the event that Vendor controls the defense of the Covered Claim,
Vendor shall retain as its lead counsel, subject to AT&T’s approval (which shall not be withheld,
conditioned or delayed except for reasons of apparent or actual conflict of interest), one or more
competent attorneys from a nationally recognized law firm who have significant experience in litigating
intellectual property claims of the type at issue, and the AT&T Indemnified Parties may, at their option
and sole expense, participate with Vendor in the defense of such Covered Claim.
(v) AT&T shall notify Vendor promptly of any Covered Claim; provided, however, that any delay in such
notice shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations under this Section, except insofar as Vendor can show
that such delay actually and materially prejudiced Vendor.
(vi) In no event shall Vendor settle, without AT&T’s prior written consent, any Covered Claim, in whole or in
part, in a manner that would require any AT&T Indemnified Party to discontinue or materially modify its
products or services (or offerings thereof). In no event shall Vendor enter into any agreement related to
any Covered Claim or to the Intellectual Property Rights asserted therein that discharges or mitigates
Vendor’s liability to the third-party claimant but fails to fully discharge all of AT&T’s liabilities as to the
Covered Loss.
(c) Continued Use of Provided Elements Upon I njunction. Without in any manner limiting the foregoing
indemnification, if, as a result of a Covered Claim, (i) the AT&T Indemnified Parties’ rights under this
Agreement are restricted or diminished, or (ii) an injunction, exclusion order, or other order from a court,
arbitrator or other competent tribunal or governmental authority preventing or restricting the AT&T
Indemnified Parties’ use or enjoyment of the Provided Elements is issued, imminent, or reasonably likely to be
issued, then, in addition to its other obligations set forth in this Section, Vendor, in any case at its sole expense
(or, in the case of a Combination Claim, at its fairly and equitably apportioned expense) and at no loss, cost
or damage to the AT&T Indemnified Parties or their customers, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain for the AT&T Indemnified Parties the right to continue using or conducting other activities with respect
to the Provided Elements (or, in the case of a Combination Claim, shall use commercially reasonable efforts,
in cooperation as reasonably needed with other interested parties, to obtain for the AT&T Indemnified Parties
the right to continue using or conducting other activities with respect to the Provided Elements in the
combination at issue); provided that if Vendor is unable to obtain such right, then Vendor

the original Provided Elements and complying fully with all the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement and all Specifications; provided further that if Vendor is unable in this way to provide such
modified or replacement non-infringing Provided Elements, then AT&T shall have the right, at its option and
without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that AT&T has in contract, law or equity: (1) to exercise any
of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum and to terminate AT&T’s obligations under this
Agreement with respect to the impacted Cell Sites and receive a reduction in the Maintenance Fees with
respect to such Cell Site(s), and/or (2) to require Vendor, as applicable, to remove, accept return of, or
discontinue the provision of the Provided Elements, to refund to AT&T the purchase price thereof or other
monies paid therefor (subject, in the case of Provided Elements other than services, to reduction based on the
amount of depreciation or amortization over the useful life of the Provided Elements at issue), and to reimburse
AT&T for any and all reasonable out-of- pocket expenses of removing, returning or discontinuing such
Provided Elements.
(d) Elimination of Ch arges. After AT&T ceases, as a result of actual or claimed infringement or
misappropriation, to exercise the rights granted under this Agreement with respect to the Provided Elements,
AT&T has no obligation to pay Vendor any Structured Payments or Maintenance Fees that would otherwise
be due under this Agreement for such rights.
(e) Exceptions. Vendor shall have no liability or obligation to any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties for that
portion of a Covered Loss which is based on (and only to the extent such portion is based on):
(i) use of the Provided Elements by the AT&T Indemnified Parties in a manner that constitutes a material
breach of this Agreement; or
(ii) an unauthorized modification of the Provided Elements by an AT&T Indemnified Party; or
(iii) Vendor’s conformance to the AT&T Indemnified Party’s written specifications, unless any one or more of
the following is true:
1. there was a technically feasible non-infringing means of complying with those specifications, unless
Vendor can show that, at the time of such compliance, such non- infringing means would have been
cost-prohibitive (whether on an individual Cell Site basis, or across multiple Cell Sites as set forth in
the Build Addendum); or
2. the relevant specifications are designed to bring the Provided Elements into compliance with, or have
the Provided Elements conform to, an industry standard, which standard is promulgated by a generally
recognized industry standards-setting body and which standard is not required for compliance with an
applicable law, ordinance, regulation,

to exercising its right to offset amounts pursuant to this Section 3.22, AT&T shall provide written notice to
Vendor of its intention to offset such amounts and to the extent any dispute between the Parties exists in

(b) License Grant to AT&T. Vendor hereby grants and promises to grant and have granted to AT&T and its
Affiliates a royalty-free, nonexclusive, sublicensable, assignable, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual, world-
wide license in and to any applicable Intellectual Property Rights of Vendor to use, copy, modify, distribute,
display, perform, import, make, sell, offer to sell, and exploit (and have others do any of the foregoing on or
for AT&T’s or any of its customers’ behalf or benefit) any Intellectual Property Rights of Vendor or any third
party that are not included in Material or Paid-For Development but necessary to operate the Cell Sites or
receive the full benefit of the Work.
(c) Further Acts and Obligations. Vendor will take or secure such action (including, but not limited to, the
execution, acknowledgment, delivery and assistance in preparation of documents or the giving of testimony) as
may be reasonably requested by AT&T to evidence, transfer, perfect, vest or confirm AT&T’s right, title and
interest in any Paid-For Development. Vendor shall, in all events and without the need of AT&T’s request,

indirectly provided to Vendor (in any form, including, without limitation, verbally) by or on behalf of AT&T or

including, without limitation, any Intellectual Property Rights in or to any AT&T Provided Items or Paid- For

limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable license (that shall automatically terminate upon the termination or
expiration of this Agreement), under any rights owned by AT&T, to use the AT&T Provided Items and Paid-
For Development solely as instructed by AT&T and to the extent necessary for Vendor to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, subject further to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In no way
expanding the foregoing license, said license in no manner permits Vendor to (and Vendor hereby promises not
to without the explicit prior written and signed consent of AT&T Intellectual Property, LLC ( “ATTIP
Consent”)) make use of any AT&T Provided Items, Paid- For Development or AT&T Intellectual Property
Rights either for the benefit of any third party or other than as instructed in writing by AT&T (AT&T may be

without the prior written ATTIP Consent. For the purpose of clarity, any disclosure of the existence of this
Agreement or the Work by Vendor as required by Law, including the regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, shall not be a violation of this section; provided that, prior to any such disclosure
being made in the first instance, Vendor shall give AT&T a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon (including any press release). To the extent that any disclosure required to be made by Vendor to
the Securities and Exchange Commission has been previously reviewed by AT&T, then Vendor shall not
be required to provide AT&T with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon prior to such
disclosure being made thereafter so long as no substantive changes have been made thereto. A breach of
this “Publicity” Section shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

its auditors will review these records first if the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority permits
such review, and provide the records to the requesting governmental authority; provided, however, the
FirstNet Authority and other governmental authorities retain the right to perform audits independent of AT&T.

regulate AT&T’s business, if required by applicable Law or if auditors require follow-up access to complete
audit inquiries or if an audit uncovers any problems or deficiencies), upon at least ten (10) business days
advance notice (unless otherwise mandated by Law) and during business hours. Vendor will cooperate, and
will ensure that its Subcontractors cooperate, in the AT&T Audits, and will make the information reasonably
required to conduct the AT&T Audits available on a timely basis.

copies of documents and information reasonably necessary to verify Vendor’s compliance with this
Agreement. Upon notification by AT&T of a discovery or legal hold request, Vendor shall fully cooperate with
such request and immediately preserve any Vendor records covered by such request and promptly provide
such Vendor records requested by AT&T related to the inquiry.
(f) Except as provided in Subsection (d), all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AT&T in
connection with an AT&T Audit shall be paid by AT&T. Vendor shall be solely responsible for all costs and
expenses incurred by Vendor in connection with its obligations under this Section. In the event that either Party
requires that an audit be performed by an independent auditor, unless otherwise specified herein, the Party
requesting such independent auditor will be responsible for the costs and expenses associated with the
independent auditor.
(g) With respect to AT&T requests for audits or inspections of Vendor’s Subcontractors, the following applies:
(i) If Vendor’s agreement with its applicable Subcontractor permits an AT&T Audit, AT&T shall be permitted
to conduct such audit directly or through a third party representative. Vendor shall work with AT&T in
facilitating the Subcontractor’s cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection.
(ii) If Vendor’s contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit
or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the
Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon
AT&T’s request and at AT&T’s expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to
terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited,
applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T. If AT&T’s request for a Vendor
audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T’s good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service
provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T’s account, and the audit in both Parties’ opinions confirms
such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor’s audit of its Subcontractor.
(iii) If Vendor’s contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and
systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor
shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to
AT&T for its review. To the extent AT&T deems it reasonably necessary to require such access, then
Vendor will renegotiate its contract with the applicable Subcontractor in order to obtain the audit rights
described in Subsection (b) above.

3.33 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the
Parties agree that the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force if both the economic
and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner
that is materially adverse to either Party by severing the provision determined to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable.
3.34 Supplier Citizenship and Sustainability. Vendor shall conduct business with an abiding respect for
corporate citizenship, sustainability, and human rights (“Citizenship and S ustainability”). Upon AT&T’s

(a) Vendor shall invoice AT&T the amount of any federal excise, state, and local transaction taxes imposed upon
the sale of Material, Delivery of Deliverables, and provision of Services under this Agreement. All such taxes
must be stated as separate items on the applicable Material, Deliverable, or Services invoice listing the taxing
jurisdiction imposing the tax. Installation, labor and other non-taxable charges must be separately stated.
AT&T shall pay all applicable taxes to Vendor that are stated on and at the time the Material, Deliverables, or

of the delay or failure of Vendor, for any reason other than AT&T’s failure to reimburse Vendor in a timely
manner for such amounts, to pay any tax or file any return or information required by law, rule, or regulation or
by this Agreement to be paid or filed by Vendor.
(c) Upon AT&T’s request, the Parties shall consult with respect to the basis and rates upon which Vendor shall
pay any taxes or fees for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement. If AT&T
determines that, in good faith and pursuant to applicable Law, any such taxes or fees are not payable or
should be paid on a basis less than the full price or at rates less than the full tax rate, AT&T shall notify Vendor
in writing of such determinations, Vendor shall make payment in accordance with such determinations, and
AT&T shall be responsible for such determinations. If collection is sought by the taxing authority for a greater
amount of taxes than that so determined by AT&T, Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T. If AT&T desires to
contest such collection, AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor. Vendor shall cooperate with AT&T in contesting
such determination, but AT&T shall be responsible and shall reimburse Vendor for any tax, interest, or penalty
in excess of AT&T’s determination and shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in
connection with contesting such determination.
(d) If the parties agree, where such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, that
AT&T has paid Vendor for any taxes in excess of the amount that AT&T is obligated to pay Vendor under this
Agreement, AT&T and Vendor shall consult in good faith to determine the appropriate method(s) to seek
recovery of such excess payments, which method(s) may include, but are not limited to, (i) Vendor crediting
any excess payments against tax amounts or other payments due from AT&T solely to the extent Vendor has
successfully made corresponding adjustments to its payments to the relevant tax authority, (ii) Vendor timely
filing claims for refund and any other documents required to recover any excess payments and Vendor
promptly remitting to AT&T all such refunds and interest received, and (iii) Vendor immediately refunding to
AT&T such excess payments.
(e) If any taxing authority advises Vendor that it intends to audit Vendor with respect to any taxes for which AT&T
is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement, Vendor shall (i) promptly so notify AT&T, (ii) afford
AT&T an opportunity to participate with Vendor in such audit with respect to such taxes, and (iii) keep AT&T
fully informed as to the progress of such audit. Except as set forth in Subsection (c) above, each Party shall
bear its own expenses with respect to any such audit, and the responsibility for any additional tax, interest, or
penalty resulting from such audit is to be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Section 3.36. Vendor’s failure to comply with the notification requirements of this Section 3.36 will relieve
AT&T of its responsibility to reimburse Vendor for taxes only to the extent that Vendor’s failure actually and
materially prejudiced AT&T’s ability to contest imposition or assessment of those taxes.
(f) In addition to its rights under Subsections (c), (d), and (e) above with respect to any tax or tax controversy
covered by this Section 3.36, AT&T is entitled to contest, pursuant to applicable Law and tariffs and at its
own expense, any tax previously invoiced that AT&T is ultimately

AT&T or Vendor that AT&T has previously paid to Vendor resulting from such a contest. Vendor shall
cooperate in any such contest, but AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in
obtaining a refund or credit for AT&T.
(g) If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other governmental entity in connection with taxes under this
Section 3.36, the other Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Party being audited in order to respond to
any audit inquiries in an appropriate and timely manner, so that the audit and any resulting controversy may be

United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN- E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, W-
8IMY, or W-9 (or any successor form prescribed by the IRS). AT&T may reduce any payment otherwise
due to Vendor in connection with the sale of Material, Delivery of Deliverables, or provision of Services under
this Agreement by the amount of any tax imposed on Vendor that AT&T is required to pay directly to a taxing
or other governmental authority (“Withholding Tax”). Alternatively, if applicable Law permits, AT&T agrees
that it will honor a valid exemption certificate or other mandated document evidencing Vendor’s exemption
from payment of, or liability for, any Withholding Tax as authorized or required by statute, regulation,
administrative pronouncement, or other Law of the jurisdiction providing said exemption. AT&T shall provide
Vendor with documentation evidencing withholding in a reasonable time.

without limitation by causing AT&T to incur taxes, costs, losses or expenses as a result of or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are incremental to those that would have been
incurred by AT&T in the absence of such change in Law), then AT&T may, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, inform the Vendor in writing of the change in Law or anticipated change in Law and the
impact or expected impact to AT&T (a “Change in Law Notice”). Within fifteen (15) days after AT&T’s
delivery of a Change in Law Notice, Vendor and AT&T shall meet in good faith to formulate an action
plan to mitigate, minimize or eliminate the impact of such change in Law on AT&T, which, upon the

Disclosure or any reference to FOSS in the Agreement shall be deemed as acceptance, approval or
acquiescence by AT&T that Vendor’s use of the FOSS complies with the legal requirements of applicable
FOSS license(s), or is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder. After receiving any FOSS
Disclosure, AT&T may, upon written notice to Vendor, ask Vendor to use alternate FOSS (or other alternate
software), if reasonably warranted to avert a risk that the rights of AT&T or its third-party Contractors in any
proprietary software may be compromised. In that event, if Vendor cannot or will not use such alternate
FOSS, then AT&T may immediately terminate the relevant purchase or funding commitments under this
Agreement, without further cost, expense or liability to AT&T.
(c) Vendor represents and warrants to AT&T: (i) that Vendor has satisfied all its obligations to any third parties
with respect to all FOSS and the applicable FOSS licenses (including, for example, any obligation to make
publicly available the FOSS source code for modifications to such FOSS); (ii) that the FOSS, in the form
publicly available the FOSS source code for modifications to such FOSS); (ii) that the FOSS, in the form
provided to AT&T, is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder; (iii) that use of the FOSS in
such form for such intent and purposes in no manner creates any added obligation on the part of AT&T
(including, for example, the payment of any additional monies), or diminishes, conditions or eliminates any of
the rights, title, or interest that Vendor grants AT&T in or to any Deliverables or that Vendor may otherwise
provide AT&T under this Agreement; and (iv) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes,
including, but not limited to, AT&T’s use or combination of the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, with
any proprietary software of AT&T or AT&T’s third-party Contractors, does not subject AT&T to any
obligation of disclosure or distribution to any third party or to the public of any such proprietary software, or
otherwise make such proprietary software subject to the terms of any FOSS license or impair AT&T’s or its
third-party Contractors’ rights, title, or interest in or to such proprietary software.
(d) In the event that AT&T notifies Vendor or Vendor becomes aware of Vendor’s noncompliance with any FOSS
license term, then in either case, Vendor shall use all reasonable efforts promptly to cure such noncompliance
so as to eliminate risks of public disclosure of proprietary software and prevent disruption of any AT&T
business activity. Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T of all actions taken by Vendor to cure such
noncompliance. Should AT&T receive notice from any third party alleging acts or omissions which,
notwithstanding AT&T’s use of the FOSS for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder, constitute
noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then promptly upon AT&T’s notice to Vendor of such allegation,
Vendor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T against such allegation in accordance with Vendor’s
obligations to do so as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, in a manner that preserves any proprietary
software of AT&T or its third-party Contractors from any public disclosure obligation or any other FOSS
license noncompliance allegations.

         TAT-14  nor the Sold  Capacity  of  TAT-14,  the  reduction  in  Design
         Capacity will be subtracted  from the CRC as determined by the Managing
         Group.
11.3     In the event that the capacity which TAT-14, or any Segment thereof, is
         capable of providing is reduced below the capacity  required to support
         the Sold  Capacity on its  existing or planned  routings as a result of
         physical deterioration,  or for other reasons beyond the control of the
         Parties,  the  Managing  Group shall  initiate a review of the capacity
         routings in order to support the  rerouting of such Sold  Capacity.  If
         necessary,  the Managing Group may further consider changes to capacity
         assignments.
11.4     Financial  adjustments  shall be made among the Parties,  as necessary,
         under  terms  and  conditions  recommended  by the  Managing  Group and
         approved by the General Committee.
12       OWNERSHIP PRICING
12.1     The TAT-14 Initial Ownership Pricing Matrix is shown in Annex 8.
12.2     In the event that the final  cost of TAT-14 is lower  than the  initial
         budget, each Party's investment shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis in
         accordance  with Schedule B, with no change to its Allocated  Capacity.
         If the final  cost of TAT-14 is higher  than the  initial  budget  each
         Party's investment shall be increased on a pro-rata basis in accordance
         with Schedule B. Schedule C shall not be affected.

         (iii)  other costs incurred under the direction of the Managing  Group,
                or the  Procurement  Group,  and those  capital  costs  directly
                incurred by the Terminal  Parties,  the CBP, the NA or any Party
                authorized  by the  Managing  Group,  which  shall  be fair  and
                reasonable in amount and not included in the Supply Contract and
                which have been directly and reasonably incurred for the purpose
                of,  or  to  be   properly   chargeable,   in  respect  of  such
                engineering, provision, construction, installation and laying of
                Segment S of  TAT-14.  Such  costs  shall  include,  but are not
                limited  to,  the  costs  of  engineering,   design,  materials,manufacturing, procurement and inspection, installation, removal
                (with appropriate  reduction for salvage),  cable ship and other
                ship costs,  route surveys,  burying,  testing  associated  with
                laying or installation, customs duties, taxes (except income tax
                imposed upon the net income of a Party),  appropriate  financial
                charges  attributable to other Parties' shares of costs incurred
                by the  Terminal  Parties or any other Party  authorized  by the
                Managing  Group,  at the  rate at  which  such  Party  generally
                incurred   such   financial   charges,   supervision,    billing
                activities, overheads and insurance or a reasonable allowance in
                lieu of insurance,  if such Party elects to carry a risk itself,
                being a risk against  which  insurance is usual or recognized or
                would have been  reasonable.  Such  costs  shall  include  costs
                incurred by the Parties in the holding of the Data Gathering and
                the General Committee  meetings but excluding  attendance by the
                Parties' representatives at such meetings. Such costs shall also
                include costs incurred by the Parties in holding the meetings of
                the Managing Group, the Procurement Group and its Working Groups
                and   the   preparation   and   attendance   by   the   Parties'

         meetings  of the AR&R  Subcommittee  and F&A  Subcommittee  established
         pursuant to Subparagraph 7.2 of this Agreement or the attendance by the
         Parties' representatives at such meetings.
13.3     Any  amounts  received  by,  or  credited  to,  a Party or the CBP as a
         consequence  of  letters of  guarantee,  liquidated  damages,  or other
         similar  amounts  resulting  from the failure of the  Supplier to fully
         perform  any  provision  of the Supply  Contract,  shall  accrue to the
         benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B.
13.4     The cost of repair or replacement of any part of TAT-14 in the event of
         damage or loss arising during construction, laying, burying, installing
         and the bringing into operation of TAT-14,  which is attributable under
         the Supply  Contract to the  Parties,  shall be regarded as part of the
         capital costs for the purpose of Subparagraph  13.1. Any of the Parties
         may at its own  expense  insure  against  such  risks so far as its own
         share of costs is concerned. Should the Managing Group agree to jointly
         insure against such risks, the cost of such insurance will form part of
         the capital costs referred to in Subparagraph 13.1.
14       ALLOCATION AND BILLING OF SEGMENTS CAPITAL COSTS
14.1     The capital  costs of Segment S of TAT-14,  as defined in Paragraph 13,

         by  agreement  of the  Parties,  shall be borne by the  Parties  in the
         proportions set forth in Schedule B.
14.2     The CBP will receive  invoices  from the Supplier for the costs due and
         included in the Supply  Contract.  The Parties  shall  promptly  render
         invoices to the CBP for the cost of items directly  incurred by them in
         accordance with Subparagraph  13.1. The CBP shall promptly render bills
         to each of the Parties for such Party's pro rata share of costs due and
         included in the invoices it has received in accordance with Schedule B.
         Such bills shall contain a reasonable  amount of detail to substantiate
         them.  On the basis of such bills,  each Party shall pay to the CBP the
         amount  owed  within  forty-five  (45)  days from the date the bill was
         rendered by the CBP in the currency shown on the respective bill.
14.3     For the purpose of this Agreement, financial charges shall be computed,
         as appropriate,  at a rate equal to the lowest publicly announced prime
         rate  or  minimum  commercial  lending  rate,  however  described,  for
         ninety-day  loans on the 1st working day of each month of the period to
         be  considered  in the Country and in the currency in which the bill is
         rendered.  With respect to the Parties  rendering  invoices  under this
         Agreement,  Annex 7 specifies those rates. If the Managing Group should
         authorize a Party in a Country other than those Parties listed in Annex
         7 to render  invoices,  the Managing Group shall specify the applicable
         rates.
14.4     For the  purposes of this  Agreement,  "paid" shall mean that the funds
         are available for immediate use by the recipient.
14.5     Bills not paid when due shall accrue extended  payment charges from theday  following  the date on which  payment was due in  accordance  with
         Subparagraph  14.2 until the day on which it is paid.  For the purposes
         of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate
         equal to 150 % of the  appropriate  financial  charges as  indicated in
         Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was
         due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended
         payment  interest  charges only at a rate less than that established in
         accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at
         the  highest  rate  permitted  by such  applicable  law.  In this case,
         appropriate  documents to  demonstrate  the  applicability  of such law
         shall be provided by the concerned Party.
14.6     Extended payment charges recovered by the CBP, in excess of the amounts
         paid or due, excluding interest paid by whichever Party or Parties have
         covered  the deficit in the  intervening  period,  shall  accrue to the
         benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B.
14.7     Procedures for rendering  credits for refunds of appropriate  financial
         charges and bills for extended payment charges will be developed by the
         CBP in conjunction with the F&A Subcommittee.

14.8     As soon as practicable  after the RFPA Date, the amount of each Party's
         share of the costs of Segment S shall be computed by the CBP which will
         make appropriate  adjustments and render any necessary bills or arrange
         for any necessary refunds by way of final settlement in order that each
         Party  may  bear its  appropriate  share of the  costs as  provided  in
         Subparagraph 14.1.
14.9     A bill shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Party to whom it is
         rendered if that Party does not present a written  objection to the CBP
         on or before  fifteen  (15) days prior to the date when payment is due.
         If such  objection  is made,  the  Parties  concerned  shall make every
         reasonable effort to settle promptly the dispute concerning the bill in
         question.  If the  objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid
         the  disputed  bill,  the agreed  upon  overpayment  shall be  refunded
         promptly to the objecting  Party by the billing Party together with any
         financial charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance
         with  Subparagraph  14.3 of this  Agreement from the date of payment of
         the  bill  to the  date on  which  the  refund  is  transmitted  to the
         objecting Party. If the objection is not sustained and the billed Party
         has not paid the disputed bill,  said Party will pay such bill promptly
         together with any extended payment charges calculated thereon at a rate
         determined in accordance with  Subparagraph 14.5 of this Agreement from
         the day  following  the date on which payment of the bill was due until
         paid.  Nothing in this  Subparagraph  shall relieve a Party from paying
         those parts of a bill that are not in dispute.  The  provisions of this
         Subparagraph  shall be  without  prejudice  to the  rights of any Party
         pursuant to Paragraph 21 of this Agreement.

         extending  capacity in TAT-14 and shall be furnished and  maintained on
         terms  and  conditions  which  shall be no less  favorable  than  those
         granted to other ITEs for  transmission  facilities of similar type and
         quantity  transiting the Country.  Such terms and conditions  shall not
         override  any  applicable  governmental  laws  and  regulations  in the
         Country in which the facilities are located.
15.3     Each  Terminal  Party  shall  provide,  within the Country of its Cable
         Station,  connection to TAT-14 at the SDH Interface  Equipment  levels,

         communications facilities in its operating Country.
15.5     Upon  request,  each  Terminal  Party  in its  Country  shall  make all
         reasonable efforts to provide to other Parties or Purchasers, or Agents
         of the Parties or Purchasers from such Terminal Party's Country, access
         to  TAT-14  in the  vicinity  of its  Cable  Station  (not  necessarily
         co-located) at the level of a Basic System Module or multiples thereof,
         given  that the  requesting  Party  or  Purchaser  has the  appropriate
         capacity  assigned to it. Such facilities shall be provided in a timely
         manner  and for the  duration  of this  Agreement  under  the terms and
         conditions  to  be  negotiated   and  agreed  between  the  Parties  or
         Purchasers concerned under a separate agreement.

         extending to its respective Segment T, on behalf of the Parties and the
         Purchasers.
16.3     All Terminal Parties as the Maintenance  Authorities,  acting on behalf
         of the Parties and  Purchasers,  shall be jointly  responsible  for the
         operation  and  maintenance  of  Segment  S from the  respective  Cable

         activities necessary for the continued operation of TAT-14.
16.4     Sixty (60) days before the RFPA Date the Maintenance  Authorities shall
         submit for review by the Procurement Group and approval by the Managing
         Group appropriate  practices and procedures for the continued operation
         and  maintenance of Segment S. The Maintenance  Authorities  shall each
         provide  information to the  Procurement  Group regarding the practices
         and  procedures  for the continued  operation and  maintenance of their
         respective  Segments.  The  Maintenance  Authorities  shall  also  each
         develop  and  furnish  such  budgetary  estimates  of the  cost of such
         operation  and   maintenance  of  TAT-14  as  the  Managing  Group  may
         reasonably   request  and   provide   this   information   to  the  F&A
         Subcommittee.  Following  the RFPA Date,  the  Maintenance  Authorities
         shall each  provide  the  Managing  Group  with such  reports as it mayreasonably require on the operation and maintenance of TAT-14 including
         any proposals for planned  repair or  improvement  work,  together with
         appropriately revised budgetary estimates relating to the operation and

         may revise the  allocation  of  responsibility  for the  operation  and
         maintenance of Segment S.
16.5     The   Maintenance   Authorities,   individually   or   collectively  as
         appropriate,  shall each use all  reasonable  efforts to  maintain,  or
         cause to be  maintained,  economically  the  Segments for which each is
         responsible,  in efficient  working order.  Each Maintenance  Authority
         shall  discharge  its   responsibility  in  a  manner  consistent  with
         applicable international submarine cable maintenance practices and with
         an objective of achieving effective and timely repairs when necessary.
16.6     The  Maintenance  Authorities  shall  have  the  right  to  temporarily
         de-activate  Segment S, or any part thereof,  in order to perform their
         duties  as  Maintenance  Authorities.   Prior  to  such  de-activation,
         reasonable notice shall be given to and coordination shall be made with
         the other  Parties.  To the extent  possible,  sixty (60) days prior to
         initiating  action,  the  Maintenance  Authority(ies)  shall advise the
         other Parties in writing of the timing, scope, and costs of significant
         planned  maintenance  operations,  of  significant  changes to existing
         operation and maintenance methods, and of contractual  arrangements for
         cable ships that will or may have a significant  impact on operation or
         maintenance costs. Should one or more Parties representing at least 5 %
         of the total  voting  interests  specified in Schedule B wish to review
         such an  operation  or change  prior to its  occurrence,  such Party or
         Parties  shall  notify the  Maintenance  Authorities  involved  and the
         Managing  Group  chairperson in writing within thirty (30) days of such
         advice.  Upon such  notification,  the  Managing  Group shall  initiate
         action to convene an ad hoc meeting for such review.

16.7     Each  Maintenance  Authority  shall  have  prompt  access to all system
         maintenance  information,  necessary to the  performance of its duties,
         appropriate to those parts of TAT-14 not covered by its authority.
16.8     No Party shall be liable to any other Party or  Purchaser  for any loss
         or damage sustained by reason of any delay in provision,  failure in or
         breakdown of the facilities  constituting TAT-14 or any interruption of
         service,  whatsoever  shall be the cause of such failure,  breakdown or
         interruption, and however long it shall last.
16.9     In the event of a failure or  breakdown of any of such  facilities,  if
         the responsible Maintenance Authority fails to restore those facilities
         to efficient working order and operation within a reasonable time after
         having  been  called  upon  to do so by any  Party  or  Purchaser,  the
         Managing  Group may, to the extent that it is practical to do so, place
         or cause to be placed,  such facilities in efficient  working order and
         operation and charge the Parties their proportionate shares of the cost
         reasonably incurred in doing it.
16.10    Each Party, at its own expense,  and upon reasonable  advance notice to
         the relevant Maintenance  Authorities,  shall have the right to inspect
         from time to time the operation and  maintenance  of any part of TAT-14
         and to obtain copies of the maintenance records. For this purpose, each
         Maintenance  Authority  shall  retain  significant  records,  including
         recorder charts,  for a period of not less than five (5) years from the
         date of the record.  If these  records are destroyed at the end of this
         period,  a summary of important items shall be retained for the life of
         TAT-14.

21.1     If any Party fails to make any payment  required by this  Agreement  on
         the date when it is due and such default  continues  for a period of at
         least two (2) months  after the date when  payment  is due,  the CBP or
         billing Party shall notify the billed Party in writing of its intent to
         notify  the  Managing  Group of the status of the matter and to request
         the  reclamation of capacity,  as provided for in this Paragraph 21, if
         full  payment  is  not   received   within  four  (4)  months  of  such
         notification  to the billed  Party.  If full  payment  is not  received
         within such  specific  period,  the billing Party or CBP may notify the

21.2     The  Managing  Group shall have the option of  reclaiming  the capacity

         capacity with the  defaulting  Party in  determining  whether or not to
         reclaim  the  capacity  assigned  to such  defaulting  Party.  Prior to
         reclaiming  the capacity  the  Managing  Group will notify the Party in
         writing that it is in default and of the intent to reclaim the capacity
         after one (1) month.  The Managing Group shall  determine  arrangements
         for disposition of any reclaimed capacity.  The remaining Parties shall
         not be  obliged  to make any  payment  to a  defaulting  Party  for the

         This Agreement shall be appropriately amended to reflect the default of
         a Party and the  reallocation  of  interests  pursuant to  arrangements
         determined by the Managing Group.

         otherwise for any direct damage unless and to the extent it is based on
         intent or gross negligence. In no event shall any employee,  servant or

AGREEMENT
between

and
TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED
MAINTENANCE FEE
1.     The Maintenance Fee shall be calculated at 17% of the License fee stipulated in
         annexure 1 for the license of the SOFTWARE.
2.     MAINTENANCE SERVICES
SAP Africa ("SAP") endeavours to provide the highest quality support and to ensure
system stability throughout the life cycle of the Software solution. TELKOM will benefit
through a lower total cost of ownership and will, in the future, experience an optimal
usage of system resources and protection of existing investments.
          7 x 24h Support Worldwide
SAP Customer Support delivers help for software problems in a fast and competent
manner. SAP provides a 7 x 24h Support availability for messages with 'very high'
priority using the 'Follow-the-Sun' model. At any given time of day an expert will be at
hand to provide advice.
All Support centres are linked through a unique Support infrastructure, ensuring that all
information provided to SAP is on hand regardless where or when.- 58 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01
Software Maintenance
Software Maintenance includes the further improvement of the software, as well as the
continuous adaptation of the software to new database and operating system versions.
 Each new release contains solutions to all known software errors.
Delivery of Functional Enhancements and Updates to the R/3 Software
SAP and its Licensors continuously enhance and improve the Software to ensure that
Licensees customers always have the latest technology and business functions (e. g.
functionality supporting the introduction of the Euro). SAP ensures that customers
always receive the latest release of the R/3 software as soon as it becomes available.
 Integrated Support for SAP and Partner Products
SAP maintains Collaborative Support Agreements with SAP Partners who have provided
Licensees with hardware, operating system and database platforms to ensure seamless
support. Should a Licensee request SAP require the involvement of the respective
partner, SAP has established interfaces and procedures to do so.
 Access to 'SAP's Frontend (formerly: OSS)
SAP'sFrontend is a quick and user-friendly interface for communication between
customers and SAP. Features include:
- Access to the Software Support Package repository for downloads
- Database access to individual problem solutions for downloads
- Knowledge Database access to a wealth of information on the use of the Software
- Electronic notification about important information (HotNews)
- Access to SAP's request handling process.
Support Services
The requirement for deriving the full benefit from SAP's Global Support Network is a remote
connection from the customer's Software System to SAP's Frontend. This enables the
efficient usage of SAP's portfolio of Remote Services and will enable customers to work with
the SAP Support experts whenever required and in particular, at the start of their- 59 -     TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01
implementation. Also, a remote connection is a prerequisite for 7 x 24h support for priority 1
messages.
Under the TeamSAP Support maintenance agreement, SAP Support deals with problem
messages pertaining to:
- An error in the software
- An error in the software causes subsequent errors
- There are problems when implementing corrections
- There is no training or documentation available
- The functions are not logical
- The software ergonomics has flaws
Messages of this nature are responded to in writing via SAP's Frontend.
Any other messages are termed consulting issues and may be processed by either SAP's
Remote Consulting department, the customer's implementation consultants or SAP
consultants. This service is, however, priced separately and is not within scope of the
maintenance agreement. Messages of this nature usually concern:
-  Processing logic of the software, the business processes and customising (questions
 regarding working with transactions, programs and screens, the contents of screens
 and printouts, etc. )
- Administration or tuning of the SAP System, of the database or the operating system
- Errors caused by a modification of the system
- A solution is clear from the short text or from the help text of the system error
Maintenance Service Levels
Optimum support with fast reaction times is the cornerstone of SAP's Support organisation.
SAP's Support process uses a three-tier Support structure:
 Local Support (in 50 countries worldwide)
Local Support Centres at SAP subsidiaries are the local contact points for customers.
During usual working hours, the Local Support Centres handle all inquiries relating to
support in the language of the respective country and, if necessary, forward them to the-60-    TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01 
appropriate local partner or the nearest Regional Support Centre. Most inquiries are
entered via SAP 's Frontend which offers all the advantages of automatic dispatching.
 Regional Support (more than 400 Support professionals in four Regional Support
Centres)
Regional Support Centres are located in Walldorf, Germany (Europe/Africa), Philadelphia,
USA (Americas), Singapore (Asia-Pacific) and Tokyo, Japan (North East Asia). These
Centres are responsible for processing support inquiries and also form part of the 7 x 24h
support network. According to the 'FoIlow-the-Sun' principle, inquiries received outside
normal working hours are automatically forwarded to the Regional Support Centre that is
currently active. Another task is the co-ordination of regional partners in their co-operation
with SAP customers.
 Development Support (Europe, Americas, Asia)
SAP Africa's Local Support Centre supports all SAP customers in the Southern Africa/Sub-
Sahara region. In the event of SAP Africa being unable to respond timeously or effectively,
the support query will be elevated to COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. consultants, in which
event, SAP Africa shall use its best endeavours to respond timeously in accordance with the
service levels stipulated in the table below.
The Quality Management processes implemented throughout the SAP Support organisation
are certified globally according to the international standard ISO 9002.
The workflow between the support levels is defined in an internal Support Level Agreement
(SLA) and SAP's Support Process Monitoring team ensures that requests are forwarded
smoothly between the support levels. SAP Africa, SAP AG and their respective licensors
shall use their best endeavours and efforts to ensure that the below mentioned Initial
Reaction Times and Projected Resolution Times ("PRT") are achieved in 80% of all cases;

The initial reaction time (IRT) is the time elapsed between message receipt at SAP ("Send to
SAP" in SAP Service System) and initial contact with the customer or change of the message
status.
The Projected Resolution Time (PRT) is the time elapsed between IRT and providing a
solution.
Priorities of messages are defined as follows:
 Very High or Priority 1
A message with priority "Very high" is justified when critical restrictions in day-to-day
operations are encountered. Critical tasks, especially time-critical jobs, cannot be performed,
due to a total system shutdown or a malfunction in a main function of the production SAP
system.
This message requires immediate processing, as the malfunction can result in serious
losses.
 High or Priority 2
A message with priority "High" is justified when serious restrictions in day-to-day operations
are encountered. Necessary tasks cannot be performed due to a malfunction or failed
function in the Software that is urgently required in the current situation.
The message requires rapid processing, because the continuing malfunction could cause a
serious interruption in the entire production system.
 Medium or Priority 3
A message with priority "Medium" is justified when restrictions in day-to-day operations are
encountered. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system.
 Low or Priority 4
A message with priority "Low" is justified when day-to-day operations are not affected or only
affected in a minor fashion. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the
system that is not used daily or is only used rarely.
(Problem situations in test systems will normally result in a priority that is one level lower than
the identical problem in a production system).- 62 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01
On the anniversary of this AGREEMENT, the parties shall enter into discussions and
negotiations for the purposes of reviewing the aforestated maintenance service level terms,
more particularly, the related commercial terms thereof including, the maintenance fee and/or
percentages; the response, processing and resolution times; the penalties that may be
payable by SAP Africa and/or its licensors for failing to comply with such times and other
aspects of the maintenance services. The parties acknowledge that the market for the
SOFTWARE in South Africa is limited and that therefor it may be difficult to ascertain market
conditions for the purposes of reviewing such commercial and related terms. Accordingly,
the parties shall take cognisance of market conditions in other countries where the
SOFTWARE is being used. Should the parties be unable to agree upon any such
amendments within 30 days from the anniversary date, then such dispute shall be referred
for determination by the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa ("AFSA") in accordance
with the rules of AFSA and to an arbitrator appointed by the Chairperson of AFSA upon
application by either party. The arbitrator shall upon request of either party, appoint a
suitably qualified expert to assist him in determining the dispute. Except in the case of
manifest error, the arbitrators' ruling shall be final and binding upon the parties but shall be
without prejudice to a party's other rights and obligations arising from the AGREEMENT.- 6 3 -    TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01  
Customer Message Support
The process of customer message support is the interface between development and
service. The process steps that impact upon the SLA are customer message recording,
preliminary checking, search for relevant error notes (known problem solution), and problem
analysis.
Life Cycle of a Customer Message
Refer to accompanying PDF for diagram 
Telkom customers can access the SAP's Frontend or SAPNet-Web Frontend and create
their own requests and messages. Customer requests and messages that are received in
writing via fax (+27 11 2356004) are first processed by the support facility of the Local
Support Centre and then recorded for further processing in SAP's internal customer support
system. A request or message is automatically assigned to an administrator in the SAP
support organization (Local Support and Regional Support for the Software) based on the
components assigned to it.
Performing preliminary checks, searching for troubleshooting information
The processor first checks whether the problem report is complete, and whether an entry has
already been made in the system containing a solution to the reported problem. This search
is conducted semi-automatically in SAP's support system. If an entry is found containing a
solution to the problem, then the person who had submitted the problem report is notified in
writing via SAPNet and the problem is closed for SAP.
Problem Analysis
If, following preliminary analysis, the Local Support level decides that the problem must be
handled by an expert in the respective component, the problem is passed on to the Regional- 64 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01
Support level. If the problem involves a program error or if the processor cannot find a
solution despite intensive analysis, he or she transfers it to the Development Support level.
The responsibility for Development Support lies with the user departments of the
development areas.
If no relevant error note (known solution) exists, the customer shall provide SAP with
sufficient test time and support, as an attempt is made to reproduce the reported problem
and to determine whether it is a problem with the software (at SAP or in the customer's
system, provided that the latter does not negatively affect the customer's operations). If this
reproduction of the problem is not possible, the next time the problem occurs, additional
analyses are performed to narrow down the source of the problem. In the meantime, the
problem receives the status of "customer action" in the support system. If special handling by
an expert is required, then it is relayed to Development Support.
Escalation Management
In the event of SAP's Support Management deciding that the standard support processes are
insufficient to solve a critical customer situation (problems as described in point 2 above) a
formal escalation process is invoked.
During this process, SAP will assign the required SAP personnel to the customer remotely
(via a remote connection) and/or on site, as appropriate. These resources will be under the
direct supervision of SAP's management and the customer will not incur any costs.
A formal de-escalation process, involving an assigned Customer Services Manager, will take
place once the critical issue has been resolved.
During the implementation phase prior to the SOFTWARE being installed, SAP AFRICA and
TELKOM will negotiate with each other to discuss and agree upon an appropriate detailed
escalation process for the Maintenance Services that SAP AFRICA and its licensors will
provide and that will apply during the said implementation phase and the "go-live" stage. The
parties shall also determine an escalation process that is appropriate for TELKOM'S needs
and business requirements when USING the SOFTWARE.-65-    TELKOM CONTRACTN0. 076C/01

          THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of the 28th day of March 2006 by THAYER EQUITY INVESTORS IV, L.P. (the
"Investor"), in favor of U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking
association in its capacity as administrative agent (in such capacity and
together with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the "Agent"), for

Agreement (defined below) (collectively and together with their respective
successors and assigns, the "Lenders").
                                    RECITALS:
          A. The Agent, Lenders and SUNTRON CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation,

Financing Agreement bearing event date herewith (as the same may be amended,

Agreement.
          D. The Investor is a shareholder of Suntron Corporation and, as such,
expects to derive benefits from the Amendment and from the credit accommodations
extended to the Borrowers pursuant to the Financing Agreement, and finds it in
its best interests to execute and deliver this Agreement to the Agent.
                                   AGREEMENTS:
          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises herein set forth and
for other good and valuable consideration, the nature, receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
          1. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms in the Financing Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
          "Required Capital Contributions" means some combination of (a) one or
     more unrestricted cash contributions to the capital of one or more of the
     Borrowers made by the Investor, and/or (b) one or more Qualified
     Subordinated Loans made by the Investor to one or more of the Borrowers, in
     each case as required under Section 2 below, in any or all cases, in an
     aggregate amount not to exceed $5,000,000 during the term of this
     Agreement.
          "Qualified Subordinated Loan" shall mean a loan or other financial
     accommodation (excluding interest paid in kind) extended by any Person to
     one or more of the Borrowers which is subordinated in right of payment and
     security to the Obligations pursuant to the terms of a written
     subordination agreement (substantially equivalent to the Subordination
     Agreement bearing even date herewith executed by the Investor in favor of
     the Agent), the proceeds of which loan or other financial accommodation
     have been delivered to the applicable Borrower(s) in the form of cash or
     cash equivalents.
          2. Contributions to Capital. The Investor agrees to make, and the
applicable Borrower(s) agree(s) to accept, Required Capital Contributions in
respect of the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3,
2006, as applicable) in an amount sufficient to cause (via an addition to
Adjusted EBITDAR in the amount of such Required Capital Contributions) the
Borrowers to comply with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement
as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and
agrees that the Investor's obligation to make Required Capital Contributions
hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 during the term
of this Agreement. The Agent further acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of
whether other "Events of Default" (as defined therein) have occurred and are
continuing under the Financing Agreement, in no event shall the Investor be
obligated to make any Required Capital Contributions hereunder if the Borrowers
have fully complied with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement
as of the last day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter for the applicable 12 Month
Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable).
          3. Timing of Required Capital Contributions. The Required Capital
Contributions shall be made within forty-five (45) days following the last day
of each Fiscal Quarter, unless the last day of such Fiscal Quarter is the same
as the fiscal year end, and in such case, ninety (90) days following such fiscal
year end.
          4. Specific Performance and Liquidated Damages. The Investor
acknowledges and agrees that if a Maintenance Event of Default (as defined in
Section 10 below) has occurred and is continuing hereunder, the Agent, for
itself and on behalf of the Lenders, shall have the non-exclusive right toobtain specific performance of the obligation of the Investor to make the
Required Capital Contributions. If specific performance is not a remedy then
available to the Agent and the Lenders for any reason, the Agent and the Lenders
will suffer damages in an amount which, due to the special nature of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, will be impracticable or extremely
difficult to ascertain. Determination of such damages would necessitate
determinations of value which would be based upon speculative determination of
the value of assets of the Borrowers and the capacity of assets of the Borrowers
to pay the Obligations and other Indebtedness of the Borrowers. Such damages are
uncertain and incapable of estimation as of the date of this Agreement and shall
remain so to the date of the occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default
hereunder. The Investor, the Agent and the Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree
that (a) an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the full amount of each Required
Capital Contribution that has not been made by the Investor and (ii) the
then-outstanding balance of the Obligations, represents a reasonable estimate of
the damages which the Agent and the Lenders will sustain upon the occurrence of
an Maintenance Event of Default hereunder, and (b) such lesser amount will be
the full, agreed and liquidated damages resulting from the occurrence of any
Maintenance Event of Default hereunder. The payment of such amount is intended
to constitute liquidated damages to the Agent and the Lenders and shall not be
deemed to constitute a forfeiture or penalty. Upon receipt by the Agent, such
amount may, in the sole discretion of the Agent, be applied to the Obligations
when and as due; provided, however, that such amount, if so applied, may not be
reborrowed by any Borrower under the Financing Agreement.
          5. Representations and Warranties. The Investor hereby represents and
warrants as follows:
          (a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not
     result in any violation of, or be in conflict with or constitute a default
     under, any agreement or under any law, statute, regulation or ordinance
     applicable to the Investor or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
     properties or assets of the Investor.

     Investor, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the

          (c) No consent or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in
     respect of, any governmental authority and no consent of any other Person
     (including, without limitation, any creditor of the Investor) is required
     in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or
     enforceability of this Agreement.
          6. Special Account. All Required Capital Contributions shall be made
by Investor via wire transfer directly into the Special Account.
          7. Unconditional Obligations, Waivers of Defenses. The obligations of
the Investor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional under any

impaired or otherwise affected except by performance in full. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by: (a)

respect of the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document (d) any exchange,
release or nonperfection of all or any portion of the Collateral, or any other
action or omission to act with respect to all or any portion of the Collateral,
or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any
guaranty for all or any of the Obligations, or any other release, extension,
settlement, compromise, indulgence or other action, inaction, change, waiver or
omission under or in respect of the Financing Agreement or any other Loan
Document, (e) the value of all or any portion of the Collateral regardless of
the manner of determining such value, (f) the subordination of the payment of
the Obligations or any part thereof to the payment of any other Indebtedness

future Indebtedness of any Borrower to the Investor or which may be asserted by
any Borrower against the Agent or the Lenders, whether or not arising under this
Agreement and whether or not arising out of any action or nonaction on the part

arising from willful or negligent acts or omissions), (j) any failure on the
part of any Borrower to perform its duties and obligations under this Agreement,

0-10 US$7.50 
10-20 US$7.00 
20-30 US$6.00 
30-50 US$5.50 
50+ US$5.00The cost of the audit will be borne by Licensor unless a discrepancy of more than five-percent (5%) is discovered, in which

i. For the purpose of this Agreement: 
(i) “Monthly Notional Volume” means the US$ (US Dollar) equivalent of the primary currency traded Client turnover, 
provided that US$ (US Dollar) conversion should be made based upon the monthly revaluation rate (last business day)

Trading Platform by Licensee. The computation of the rebates received by Licensee shall be expressed as a fixed percentage (15%) of 
Billable Platform Fees paid by Licensee to Licensor. The rebates shall be payable in shares of Licensor’s Common Stock; priced at $.25

rebate to Licensee will be calculated as follows:

before, after, or during the pendency of any arbitration. The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of either Party to resort to
arbitration. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute
a waiver of the right of either Party to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if the other Party contests such action for judicial relief.

Problem Reports or Support Requests to VNE prior to conducting such activities
or if Converge has determined that the Problem Report or Support Request does

step-by-step manner as is reasonably possible), or verify the existence of the
Problem, plus any additional information regarding the Problem that Converge
believes will assist in the diagnosis thereof and response thereto. The parties
shall reasonably cooperate to obtain and provide to VNE any additional
information about the reported Problem that may be relevant to diagnosing and

accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however,

will review all Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the Problem Severity
Level indicated by Converge unless another Problem Severity Level is clearly
warranted. In the event of a reasonable uncertainty, the parties will assume a
higher Severity Level for a Problem until they have sufficient information to
make a determination that a lower Severity Level is warranted. If, at Converge's
request, VNE responds to a Problem at a Severity Level that is higher than what
proves to be the actual Severity Level of the Problem, or if VNE's review of a
Problem reported by Converge establishes that the Problem was not due to an
Error, Converge shall pay or reimburse VNE for all incremental fees and expenses
reasonably incurred by VNE in performing such activities.

responding to at such time.
            2.8 Tracking Procedures. VNE will maintain procedures and systems
designed to ensure that Problem Reports and Support Requests submitted by
Converge are properly logged and tracked. In addition, VNE will provide to
Converge a weekly status log of Problem Reports and Support Requests currently
being tracked. Such report shall identify, as appropriate, each Problem Report
or Support Request as submitted by Converge, the Severity Level for each
identified Problem, the date and time each Problem Report or Support Request was
received by VNE, an assessment of the Problem Report or Support Request and an
action plan detailing the proposed method of resolution, and an estimated time
schedule for delivery of any necessary Error corrections.

facilities (including all associated telecommunications charges). VNE shall not
be responsible for any delay in providing Maintenance and Support Services under
this Agreement to the extent such delay is due to Converge's adoption of
unreasonable network security procedures or requirements.

with Maintenance Updates as VNE makes them generally available to its other

provided by VNE, taking into consideration any testing and customization
required by Converge (the parties expect that the time for such installation5
generally will not exceed 90 days). Should Converge find one or more material

tangible personal property, including any storage media, as a result of the
delivery of any Maintenance Update or associated Documentation under this
Agreement.
            2.12 Acceptance. Each Maintenance Update will be deemed accepted by
Converge upon Converge's receipt of the complete delivery thereof to a Converge
computer located at a Converge place of business.

Converge with any recommendations that VNE may have as to how Converge should
implement the desired modification. VNE shall have no responsibility for any
Problems, Errors or other issues with respect to the Supported Products that are
due to Converge's failure to ask for or follow any such recommendations of VNE.
      3. Professional Services.
            3.1 Project Managers. Each of Converge and VNE shall appoint a
Project Manager to coordinate such party's activities with respect to the
Professional Services hereunder. The initial VNE Project Manager shall be
Michael Decker and the initial Converge Project Manager shall be Farooq Ahmad.
Either party may change its Project Manager on notice (via e-mail or in some
other reasonable fashion not necessarily in accordance with the express notice
                                        6
provisions of this Agreement) to the other party's Project Manager and
Relationship Manager at any time.
            3.2 Monthly Work Plans. As reasonably requested by either party, the
Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will conduct planning
meetings to determine the Professional Services that VNE will provide to
Converge for each month during the Term. In connection with each such planning
meeting, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will jointly
prepare a written work summary or plan (each, a "Work Plan") indicating the
Professional Services to be performed by VNE for such month. The Work Plan shall
identify those Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate can be
performed without causing VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis
for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the
Quarterly Allocation for any quarter during the Term. All Professional Services
that the Project Managers anticipate will cause VNE to materially exceed (on a
pro-rata monthly basis for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed
upon in writing) the Quarterly Allocation shall either be separately identified
in the applicable Work Plan or performed by VNE pursuant to a Statement of Work
prepared in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 3. The
Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager may amend any Work Plan
upon their written agreement at any time.
            3.3 Training to Converge. VNE will provide, and the Work Plans will
encompass as appropriate, VNE providing reasonable training and available
training materials to enable Converge to provide Level 1 support for the
Supported Products ("Support Training"). Support Training will include both
introductory training reasonably in advance of when new Supported Products are
put into production by Converge and periodic refreshers as appropriate when
Maintenance Updates and Vert-General Release Enhancements are released. Support
Training will be provided at mutually agreed locations and times.
            3.4 Environment and Deployment Process. As part of the Professional
Services provided by VNE, VNE will create a document entitled, "Environment and
Deployment Process." This document will detail the recommended Supported Product
environments and the build and deployment process for the Supported Products.VNE agrees to complete a draft of this document for Converge's review within 30
days following the Effective Date. Converge agrees to review and provide final
comments on this draft document within 30 days after receipt thereof. Both
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach a mutual agreement on
the document and execute the final document within 90 days following the
Effective Date.
            3.5 Initial Request and Response. If Converge desires that VNE
perform any Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate would
cause VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis for the given
quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the Quarterly
Allocation, Converge shall submit to VNE a written request for such Professional
Services, which request shall detail the Professional Services being requested
in reasonable detail. Within 45 days after VNE's receipt of Converge's request
for VNE to perform any such Professional Services, VNE shall furnish to Converge
a preliminary statement of work (including proposed pricing, which shall take
into account any portion of such work that will be covered by a portion of the
Quarterly Allocation) under which VNE would be willing to perform such
Professional Services for Converge (each, a "Proposed SOW"). VNE may respond to
                                        7
separate requests for Professional Services in a single Proposed SOW; provided,
however, that the Proposed SOW will itemize the foregoing information separately
for each of the requested Professional Services.
            3.6 Finalization of Proposed SOWs. If Converge desires to have VNE
provide any Professional Services under the terms of a Proposed SOW, Converge
shall notify VNE thereof in writing. Should Converge wish to negotiate the terms
of the Proposed SOW, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager
shall promptly and in good faith discuss and agree upon what revisions, if any,
should be made to the Proposed SOW. Should the Converge Project Manager and the
VNE Project Manager reach mutual agreement on such revisions, if any, the
Proposed SOW shall be finalized and executed by both parties in writing (each, a
"Final SOW").
            3.7 Change Orders. Either party may request changes to a previously
agreed upon Final SOW. In such event, VNE will inform Converge the impact of
such changes. Changes to any Final SOW will be specified in a written change
order or amendment to the Final SOW. Neither party shall be bound by any change
order or amendment to a Final SOW unless and until such change order or
amendment has been executed by both parties in writing.
            3.8 Implementation. VNE will use commercially reasonable efforts to
perform all Professional Services covered by a Work Plan or Final SOW in
accordance with the schedule for performance of such Services set forth therein
(or within a reasonable time, with due regard for the consequences of delayed
performance, if no such schedule is set forth). Converge will reasonably
cooperate with VNE in connection with its performance of such Professional
Services as specified in the corresponding Work Plan or Final SOW and as may
otherwise be reasonably requested by VNE. VNE shall not be liable for any
default or delay in performance of such Professional Services to the extent the
same is attributable to the failure of Converge to comply in any material
respect with its obligations under this Agreement or any Work Plan or Final SOW.
            3.9 Method of Delivery. VNE will transfer to Converge all
Converge-Requested Enhancements to Converge, and any associated&bbsp;Documentation,
by remote telecommunications from the VNE place of business, to a Converge
computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, if any. If any such Converge-Requested Enhancement and/or
associated Documentation cannot be delivered via remote telecommunications to a
Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, such Enhancement and/or Documentation will be installed by VNE on

tangible personal property, including any storage media, as a result of the
delivery of any Converge-Requested Enhancement or associated Documentation under
this Agreement.
            3.10 Acceptance. Each Converge-Requested Enhancement provided to
Converge under a Final SOW will be subject to acceptance testing by Converge in
accordance with the provisions of its corresponding Final SOW. All other
Converge-Requested Enhancements provided to Converge under this Agreement will
be deemed accepted by

perform and sublicense the Converge-Independent Materials and the Third-Party
Materials, in both Source Code and Object Code formats, and to make unlimitedinstantiations thereof, for any and all purposes. As used herein, "Converge

brand names and other brand features of Converge and its licensors (other than
Vert). As used herein, "Third-Party Materials" means any products or materials

Converge shall use reasonable efforts to identify to VNE all relevant
Third-Party Materials in the applicable Work Plan or Final SOW.
            3.12 License Rights of Converge. The scope of Converge's license
rights to each Converge-Requested Enhancement shall be as set forth in the
Subscription License Agreement and, if relevant, the applicable Final SOW.
Except as may be set forth in the Subscription License Agreement or as the
parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, Converge acknowledges and
agrees that Vert has no obligation to deliver Source Code for any
Converge-Requested Enhancement, or to grant Converge any license to use the
Source Code form of any Converge-Requested Enhancement.
            3.13 Installation and Configuration. Converge shall be responsible
for installing and configuring any Converge-Requested Enhancements provided by
VNE hereunder. Converge may request, and VNE will provide, reasonable assistance
to Converge in its efforts to install and configure such Enhancements as part of
the Professional Services provided hereunder.
            3.14 Third-Party Technology. Except as the parties may otherwise

or expenses in connection with the performance or implementation of a Work Plan
or Final SOW unless such Work Plan or Final SOW reasonably contemplates that
such party shall be responsible for such costs or expenses, or such party
otherwise agrees in writing to incur such costs and expenses.
                                        9
            3.16 Escalation Procedures. Should the Converge Project Manager and
the VNE Project Manager be unable to reach agreement on any matter within the
scope of their discretion under this Section 3, the matter shall be escalated to
the parties' respective Relationship Managers for discussion. In addition,
should either party believe that the other party has failed to fulfill its
obligations under Section 2 or this Section 3 above, the matter shall be
escalated to the parties' respective Relationship Managers for discussion. The
initial VNE Relationship Manager shall be William Swank and the initial Converge
Relationship Manager shall be Francesco DeMarchis. Either party may change its
Relationship Manager on notice (via e-mail or in some other reasonable fashion
not necessarily in accordance with the express notice provisions of this
Agreement) to the other party's Project Manager and Relationship Manager at any
time, except that the Relationship Manager always shall be at the director level
or higher.
      4. Fees and Payments.
            4.1 Minimum Fee During Initial Term. Converge shall pay to VNE a
minimum fee of Four and One-Half Million Dollars ($4,500,000) for VNE's
provision of the Services during the Initial Term (the "Initial Term Minimum
Fee"). Converge shall pay the Initial Term Minimum Fee to VNE in 18 equal
installments of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (each, a "Monthly
Installment"). Converge shall pay the first such Monthly Installment to VNE on
the date this Agreement is executed and delivered by both parties. Thereafter,
Converge shall pay each such Monthly Installment to VNE no later than the first
day of each month during the Initial Term (November 2001 and through March
2003). All such Monthly Installments are non-refundable.
            4.2 Minimum Fee During Each Renewal Term. If the Parties mutually
agree in writing to renew this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the minimum
fee payable by Converge to VNE during any such renewal period shall be as
mutually determined by the Parties.
            4.3 Application of Quarterly Allocation; Out-Of-Scope Services. For
each quarter during the Term of this Agreement that Converge pays the applicable
Monthly Installments, Converge shall be entitled to receive Services in an
amount equal to the Quarterly Allocation; provided, however, that VNE shall
provide all Maintenance and Support Services with respect to Problem Reports
(but not with respect to Support Requests) reported during such quarter, and all
Maintenance Updates released by VNE during such quarter, regardless of whether
the provision of such Services would cause VNE to exceed the Quarterly
Allocation for such quarter; and provided further, however, that if Converge
fails to make a Monthly Installment when due (subject to the cure period in
Section 9.2(c)), VNE shall not be required to provided additional Services
during the remaining portion of the applicable quarter until such payment is
made. Should Converge request and VNE provide any Professional Services, or any
Maintenance and Support Services with respect to Support Requests, that would
cause VNE to exceed the Quarterly Allocation for any quarter, then Converge
shall pay VNE's then-current time charges, or such other charges as the parties
may otherwise agree in any Final SOW ("Out-Of-Scope Services"), for such
Out-Of-Scope Services. VNE shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform
Converge that any Professional Services requested by Converge would be
Out-Of-Scope Services prior to VNE's performance of such Professional Services.Converge shall not be required to pay for and VNS shall not be required to
perform any such Services that have not been approved in a Work Plan or Final
SOW, or otherwise approved by Converge in writing.
                                       10
            4.4 Materials Costs and Expenses. Converge will reimburse VNE for
all reasonable materials costs and expenses actually incurred by VNE in
providing the Services under this Agreement, including travel and related
expenses; provided, however, that VNE shall bear any travel or related expenses
incurred by VNE at its sole option or as may be required in connection with the
correction of any Error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if travel is required
due to the unavailability of remote access (see Section 2.9), then Converge
shall reimburse VNE for the reasonable costs of such travel and related
expenses. Upon Converge's request, the parties shall prepare budgets of any
materials costs and expenses to be incurred by VNE in its performance of any
Professional Services hereunder and any costs or expenses in excess of the
applicable budgeted amounts shall be subject to Converge's written approval,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. VNE's invoices for all
travel and related expenses shall be reasonably itemized and list all such
expenses by category/person/trip, and be accompanied by reasonable documentation
sufficient to support the deductibility by Converge of the reimbursable expense.
            4.5 Invoicing and Payments. Converge shall pay the Monthly
Installments to VNE on the dates specified in Section 4.1 and, if applicable,
Section 4.2 above. All other amounts due under this Agreement will be invoiced
by VNE to Converge on a monthly basis in arrears. All such invoiced amounts
shall be due to VNE within 30 days following Converge's receipt of VNE's
invoice. All payments will be made by Converge in U.S. dollars, without setoff,
recoupment or deduction. All fees and other amounts not paid when due shall be
subject to late charges of the lesser of (a) 1.5% per month of the overdue
amount or (b) the maximum permitted under applicable law.
            4.6 Taxes. The fees and other payments specified in this Agreement
are exclusive of any sales, use and other taxes on consumption of goods and
services ("Sales Taxes"), however designated or levied, based on this Agreement,
delivery of the Services under this Agreement, or Converge's or its Affiliates'
use thereof. In those jurisdictions in which VNE determines it is required to
register, collect and remit Sales Taxes, VNE will separately invoice Converge
for such Sales Taxes (which invoices shall be payable by Converge as set forth
in Section 4.5), collect such Sales Taxes from Converge and remit such Sales
Taxes to the proper taxing authority. In those jurisdictions in which VNE has
determined that it does not have a collection responsibility, Converge will be
required to self-assess and remit any Sales Taxes due on the purchase of taxable
property and services acquired under this Agreement. Converge will retain
ultimate responsibility and liability for remitting any Sales Taxes due on the
purchase of any property and/or services acquired under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any interest, penalties or additions attributable
to or imposed on or with respect to any such assessment excluding any taxes
imposed upon the net income of either party). Subject to the express provisions
of this Agreement, the parties will cooperate and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize or avoid, to the maximum extent allowed by law,
the obligation to pay any Sales Taxes that may be levied on payments made under
this Agreement or otherwise are chargeable by any applicable government
authority with respect to the Services.
            4.7 Tax Withholding. If laws, rules or regulations require
withholding of any taxes imposed upon amounts payable to a party hereunder, the
other party shall make such withholding payments as required and subtract such
withholding payments from the amounts payable to such party. The other party
shall submit reasonable proof of payment of the
                                       11
withholding taxes to such party within 30 days after obtaining such proof. The
parties agree to fully cooperate with each other, including, without limitation,
in the filing of appropriate certificates of tax exemption, to ensure that any
withholding payments required to be made by the other party are reduced or
avoided to the fullest extent permitted by law. Converge shall be deemed to be
the sole payor of payments owed to VNE under this Agreement and shall not have
the right to substitute any domestic or foreign affiliate for that purpose, and
if Converge reincorporates or otherwise reorganizes as a foreign person that
would thereupon cause payments hereunder to VNE to become subject to
withholding, then Converge shall comply with applicable laws to the extent
required and shall gross up the payments otherwise owed to VNE so that VNE
receives, net of withholding taxes, the amounts VNE would have received if
Converge had not substituted a foreign person or had remained a domestic person.
      5. Warranty.
            5.1 Services Warranty. VNE warrants that the Services provided
hereunder will be provided in accordance with generally-accepted industry
standards applicable to the performance of services of a similar nature. In the
event of any breach of the foregoing warranty, and provided that Converge
reports such breach to VNE in writing within 90 days following the date of
performance of the Services in question, VNE shall, as its sole obligation and
Converge's sole and exclusive remedy, promptly repair, replace or re-perform the
Services in question, without additional cost to Converge, so as to correct the
warranty non-compliance as promptly as practicable (within 30 days to the extent
technically feasible).
            5.2 Disclaimer. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PROVIDEDIN SECTION 5.1 AND AS THE PARTIES MAY OTHERWISE AGREE IN ANY WORK PLAN, VNI AND
ALL AFFILIATES OF VNI SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS RELATING TO ANY SERVICES, MAINTENANCE UPDATES OR
ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
      6. Limitation of Liability.
            6.1 Disclaimer of Liability for Certain Damages.

                                    Exhibit A
                           Severity Levels of Problems
The following chart describes the distinctions between the different severity
levels for Problems reported by Converge.
Severity    Definition
Level
         
1           A "Severity Level 1" Problem is one where critical or central
            functionality of the Supported Product is unavailable and the
            Supported Product cannot reasonably be used, or performance of
            critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is
            severely degraded, and in either such case Converge does not have or
            cannot implement a reasonable workaround. The adverse impact of a
            Severity 1 Problem on Converge's business is severe and immediate,
            and requires an immediate solution. A "Severity Level 1" Problem may
            have one or more of the following characteristics, in each case
            without Converge being able to implement a reasonable workaround:
            -     Data is corrupted or lost by the Supported Product, or the
                  Supported Product returns incorrect results, and such
                  corruption, loss or incorrect results have a material adverse
                  impact on critical or central functionality of the Supported
                  Product
            -     Complete or severe lack of ability to use the critical or
                  central functionality of the Supported Product
            -     The Supported Product crashes repeatedly
            -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is
                  not operational or is severely degraded
            -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product
                  fails to run to completion
2           A "Severity Level 2" Problem is one where critical or central
            functionality of the Supported Product is unavailable, or
            performance of critical or central functionality of the Supported
            Product is severely degraded, but in either such case Converge can
            implement a reasonable workaround but such workaround does not
            downgrade the Problem to Severity Level 3 or 4. Use of critical or
            central functionality of the Supported Product can continue in a
            restricted fashion through use of such workaround, but the user
            still experiences a significant degradation of performance of such
            functionality. A "Severity Level 2" Problem may have one or more of
            the characteristics of a "Severity Level 1" Problem, but critical or
            central functionality of
            -     the Supported Product can continue to operate in a restricted
                  fashion through use of such workaround.
3           A "Severity Level 3" Problem causes minimal interruption to
            non-central or non-important functionality. The Problem has a minor
            impact or is inconvenient. A "Severity Level 3" Problem may have one
            or more of the following characteristics:
            -     Performance of the Supported Product is degraded in a
                  non-critical manner
            -     Performance of the Supported Product is minimally impaired21
         
4           A "Severity Level 4" Problem causes no loss of use of the Supported
            Product. The following would be "Severity Level 4" Problems:
            -     Cosmetic problem with the Supported Product
            -     Documentation error
            -     Minor incorrect behavior of the Supported Product that does
                  not impede its operation

                          FIRST AMENDMENT TO SAGEBRUSH
                      MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT
     THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO SAGEBRUSH MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT
("Amendment") is made and entered into as of December 1, 1990 by and among
Sagebrush, a California general partnership ("Partnership"), the undersigned
partners of the Partnership, being all of the Sagebrush partners ("Partners"),
and ToyoWest Management Inc., a California corporation ("Manager"), with respect
to the following facts and circumstances:
                                 R E C I T A L S
                                 ---------------
     A.  The Partnership, all of the Partners except Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc.
and Beta Mariah (Prime) Inc., and Manager entered into that certain Sagebrush
Management and Maintenance Agreement, dated as of September 1, 1989 (the
"Agreement").
     B.  Concurrently herewith, all of the Partners are entering into a First
Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Sagebrush General Co-Ownership
Partnership Agreement, by which the Partners agree, among other things, that
Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. are admitted to the
Partnership.
     C.  The Partnership, the Partners and Manager desire to amend the Agreement
to extend the term of the Agreement and to add a new section concerning
curtailment of the LIFO Partners (as defined below), all as set forth in this
Amendment.
     NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the foregoing premises, the parties
hereby agree as follows:
     1.   Amendment.
          ---------
          (a)  Section 6.1 of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended by
deleting the date "September 30, 2003" where it appears therein, and inserting
in its place the date "July 20, 2006".
          (b)  A new Section 7.4 is hereby added to the Agreement, as follows:
               "7.4 Disconnection of LIFO Partners. In addition to the other
rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners
(or their Partner Affiliates), Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha
Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates,
the "LIFO Partners") in the following circumstances.
If at any time, and for any reason other than force majeure affecting the
Transmission Line, (i) the Transmission Line is incapable of delivering power at
its designed capacity, availability or voltage and curtailment of the Projects
of the LIFO Partners would improve the capability of the transmission Line to
deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or (ii) the
Transmission Line line losses exceed 1.14%, the excess line losses have an
adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Mariah, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Beta
Mariah, Beta Mariah (Prime), or Gamma Mariah or their Partner Affiliates, and
curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such
excess line losses, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses for either of the
power purchase contracts commonly known as Desert Winds I and Desert Winds III
exceed the levels experienced immediately prior to the addition of the Projects
of the LIFO Partners to the Transmission Line, the excess line losses have an
adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Joshua, Alpha Joshua (Prime), Beta
Joshua, Beta Willow or Beta Willow (Prime) or their Partner Affiliates, and
curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such
excess line losses, then the Manager shall curtail the Projects of the LIFO
Partners. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of
the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of
that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision
shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power
at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the
Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects
of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager
shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not
result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment. If the
LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them
concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the
Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such
priority. If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall
in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to
curtail. The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to
eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any
expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners.
In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no
change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous
consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld."
          (c)  Existing Section 7.4 shall be renumbered as Section 7.5.2
          (d) All references in the Agreement to Manager as "ToyoWest Management
Company" shall be interpreted as referring to "ToyoWest Management Inc.," the
correct name of Manager.
     2.  Continuing Validity. Except as expressly modified by Section 1 of this
         -------------------
Amendment, all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect. By execution of this Amendment, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and
Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. hereby become parties to the Agreement and agree to be
bound by all of the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment.
     3.   Miscellaneous. The provisions contained in Article 10 of the Agreement
          -------------
are hereby incorporated herein by this cross-reference.
                                       3
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Partnership, the Partners, and Manager have
caused this Amendment to be executed on the dates set forth below the signatures
of their respective representatives.

have adopted and implemented programs and procedures intended to ensure safe and reliable operation of the Facilities.
The rights and obligations in this Section 2.2 are without duplication of the rights and obligations of Owner and Operator as Buyer and Seller
under, and as defined in, the MESPA.
Section 2.3 Service Fees.
(a) Owner shall compensate Operator for the Facility Services for each Facility, on an annual basis at the rate specified in Exhibit A hereto (the
“Service Fees”). With respect to each year of such Facility’s Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior
to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall
be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of
one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide
or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.
(b) In connection with Facility Services for the BOF, Operator shall provide all required labor but shall charge Owner for, and Owner shall
reimburse Operator for, the cost of all required spare parts. Billing for such spare parts shall be done in the same manner as Services Fees, as set
forth in Section 2.3(a).
Section 2.4 Facility Services Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF
necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the “ System Service Warranty”). In the event that Owner desires Operator to
service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner
quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.
Section 2.5 Facility Service Warranty Claims.
(a) If Owner desires to make a Facility Service Warranty claim during the Warranty Period, Owner must notify Operator of the defect or other
basis for the claim in writing.
(b) In the case of a claim relating to the Power Performance Warranty for a One-Month  Power Performance Period or the Efficiency Warranty,
upon receipt of such notice and verification by Operator that such One-Month  Power Performance Warranty or Efficiency Warranty is applicable,
Operator (or its designated subcontractor) or the Service Provider (or its designated subcontractor) will promptly repair or replace, at Operator’s
sole option and discretion, any Bloom System whose repair or replacement is required in order for the Portfolio to perform consistent with the
Power Performance Warranty or the Efficiency Warranty, as applicable. Owner is hereby notified that refurbished parts may be used in repair or
replacement,
13
Source: BLOOM ENERGY CORP, DRS/A (on S-1), 3/21/2018but any such refurbished parts will have passed the same inspections and tests performed by Operator on its new parts of the same type before
such refurbished parts are used in any repair. If such repair or replacement is not possible (as determined at Operator’s sole option and discretion),
Operator will refund the Purchase Price of any such Bloom System to Owner notwithstanding Section 7.1. in which case Operator shall be deemed
to have taken title to such Bloom System, and such Bloom System shall be deemed to no longer constitute a portion of the Portfolio. Operator shall
make such determination as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 90 days of Operator’s receipt of notice of the claim unless the specific
nature of the problem requires a longer period in which to make such determination. If it is determined that a Bloom System will be removed
pursuant to this Section 2.5. Operator shall at its sole cost and expense remove the Bloom System and any other ancillary equipment (including the
concrete pad and any other improvements to the Site to extent required under the Site Lease) from the Site, restoring the Site to its condition before
the installation, including closing all utility connections in the manner required by all applicable Legal Requirement and Site Lease.
(c) In the case of a claim relating to the Power Performance Warranty for a One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period, upon receipt of
such notice and verification that such One-Year Power Performance Warranty is applicable, Operator shall make a payment to Owner in an amount
to be calculated pursuant to Section 2.6; provided  that the cumulative aggregate amount of Operator’s liability for all claims under this Section
2.5(c) shall not exceed [***] of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase
price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or for which a pending claim has been made under the Power Performance
Warranty or the Section 8.2(b) Warranty, as applicable, under the MESPA).
Section 2.6 Power Performance Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall determine (i) for each full calendar month (the “One-
Month  Power Performance Warranty Period”) within five (5) Business Days after the end of such month and (ii) for the most recent Look Back
Period (the “One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period”, and, together with the One-Month  Power Performance Warranty Period, each a “Power
Performance Warranty Period”), whether the Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during such Power Performance Warranty Period have delivered to the
Interconnection Point the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period (the “ Power Performance Warranty”). If such Power
Performance Warranty calculation indicates that the Actual kWh of the Bloom Systems was less than the Minimum kWh during such Power
Performance Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under
Section 2.5. An example of a Power Performance Warranty calculation for purposes of a Section 2.5 claim is attached as Appendix D.
Section 2.7 Efficiency Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall determine for each full calendar month (the “ Efficiency Warranty
Period”) within five (5) Business Days after the end of such month whether the Portfolio has performed at the Minimum Efficiency Level (the
“Efficiency Warranty”); provided  that the Efficiency Bank shall be utilized to the extent necessary to meet the Efficiency Warranty. If the Minimum
Efficiency Level has

may make a claim under Section 2.5. An example of an Efficiency Warranty calculation for purposes of a Section 2.5 claim is attached as Appendix E.
Section 2.8 Gas Payment Shortfall. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform such services on the Bloom Systems as shall cause the
Efficiency Bank to maintain a positive balance at all times. If the Efficiency Bank reaches a balance of less than zero during the Warranty Period,
Operator shall reimburse Owner for any Gas Payment Shortfall that Owner incurs within ten (10) days after Owner provides notice to Operator of
such shortfall amount; provided  that Operator’s cumulative aggregate liability under this Section 2.8 plus any payments required to be made by
Operator under Section 2.5(c) shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom
Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or
for which a pending claim has been made for under the Gas Payment Shortfall under the MESPA), less (ii) the aggregate of all amounts paid by
Operator (or claimed against Operator in the case of any claims that are pending at the time of such calculation) with respect to claims under Section
2.5(c) hereunder or Sections 8.2(b) and 8.3(c) of the MESPA. An example of a Gas Payment Shortfall calculation for purposes of a Section 2.8 claim
is attached as Appendix F.

The Code is entitled Guide to Maintaining Roadworthiness, and is published by HMSO.   The Preface to the Code repeats the caveat in the Department’s Guide to Operator Licensing that the ultimate test of an operator’s maintenance system is the condition of his vehicles on the road.   It assures operators that if their maintenance systems accord with the Code they will be acceptable to Traffic Commissioners, providing the resulting condition of their vehicles is satisfactory. However, it adds a rider that Traffic Commissioners remain free to require more stringent arrangements than those which the operator proposes.   Advice contained in the code   The Code offers much sensible advice on what is acceptable. It thus fills the gap which previously existed between the legal requirement for safe operation and the means by which this can be fulfilled. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) is now much more specific than hitherto about these means.   VOSA examiners have always been prepared to visit operators and advise them on their maintenance. The VOSA is now an Executive Agency with a commercial remit, self funded by the fees it charges for inspections it provides for a commercial fee, courses for goods vehicle operators’ staffs responsible for inspecting vehicles.   The Code places considerable emphasis on regular inspections of vehicles, including a daily “walkround check”, the keeping of records of inspections (Croners’ Road Transport Operation: Records and Procedures gives valuable information on the types of records to be kept), and the importance of driver defect reports (including the making of NIL Defects reports where appropriate).   The practice of keeping defect reports and records of inspection for 15 months is confirmed in the Code.   A clear indication is given that safety inspections should follow a pattern based on time, and that the interval of time between inspections should be determined by operating conditions.   Operators are advised to own or have access to means of measuring braking efficiency. The VOSA is currently offering, on an experimental basis, this facility to operators at some goods vehicle testing stations.   32***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omitted portions have been filed separately with the Commission.   Maintenance Staff   Vehicle maintenance must be carried out by qualified maintenance staff so that the driver is well supported in his operational duties thus enabling him to give maximum productivity during his working hours.   Fleet maintenance should be planned, with regular vehicle testing and inspection, to minimise breakdowns on the road and to assist maximum vehicle utilisation.   The Driver’s Responsibilities   The driver is the operator’s representative and as such is responsible — with his employer — for any infringement of the law and he should therefore have a working knowledge of the appropriate regulations.   Whatever the standards laid down by vehicle operators for maintenance and servicing, ultimately it is the driver who is responsible for reporting on performances He, more than anyone else, handles the vehicle under load, which is the only time when a true test of vehicle performance can be obtained. The driver, therefore, must ensure that he reports in good time, to the maintenance staff, any defects likely to infringe the law or affect the safety requirements. For such purposes a Vehicle Defects Report Sheet should be supplied by the operator to his driver so that any abnormalities can be recorded and dealt with as soon as possible.   The items for checking and reporting on the Defects Report Sheet are:   (a) fuel, oil and water   (b) brakes   (c) tyre condition and inflation pressures, spare wheel and jack   (d) wheel security, making sure that:   (i) all nuts and studs are tight   (ii) no nuts or studs are missing   (iii) no cracks are evident around wheel holes and where the centre joins the rim   (iv) where a wheel has been replaced recently the nuts are tight (these should be checked again after 30 minutes of the work being carried out)   Note: A vehicle should not be moved if any problems are found which should be reported immediately.   (e) driving mirrors, windscreen wipers and washers   (f) lights and reflectors   (g) stop-lights and direction indicators    (h) steering   33***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Headlamps, front and rear fog lamps, reversing lamps (if fitted) must be set so they do not cause dazzle to other road users Also, all obligatory lamps and reflectors (including rear reflective markings) must be kept clean and in good working order.   34***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Garman represents and warrants that it owns or controls all rights necessary to
grant the rights to Sparkling in accordance with this Agreement and that there
are not, nor will there be, any lien, encumbrance, security interest or other
rights against the Work which will interfere in any way with the rights granted

claim within ten calendar days of a responsible officer of Sparkling becoming
aware of such claim. If the Work or any portion thereof is held to constitute an
infringement of another Person's rights, and use thereof is enjoined, Garman
shall, at its election and expense, make every reasonable effort to correct the
situation with minimal effect upon the operations of Sparkling and shall either:
     (a)    procure the right to use the infringing element of the Work;

portion is no longer infringing and still performs the same function without any
material loss of functionality.
14.  CONFIDENTIALITY
     By virtue of this Agreement, the parties may have access to information
that is confidential to one another ("Confidential Information"). Confidential
Information means all data and information related to the business and
management of either party, including proprietary and trade secrets, technology
and accounting records for which access is obtained by the other party pursuant
to this Agreement, provided that such Confidential Information shall not include
data or information which:
     (a)    is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the other
party;
     (b)    is already in the rightful possession of the other party prior to

confidence. The parties agree not to make each other's Confidential Information
available in any form to any third party or to use each other's Confidential
Information for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement. Each party
agrees to take all reasonable steps to ensure the Confidential Information is
not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of this
Section.
15.  LIMITATION OF GARMAN'S LIABILITY
     The exclusive remedy of either party in a claim against the other under
this Agreement shall be the recovery of its direct damages. In no event shall
either party be liable to the other for the recovery of any special, indirect or
consequential damages even if the defendant party had been advised of the
possibility of such damages including but not limited to lost profits, lost
revenues, failure to realize expected savings, loss of data and loss of use. The
parties agree that the limitation of liability in this paragraph reflects the

7. ALLOCATION AND BILLING OF APCN 2 COSTS
 
7.1 The APCN2 Capital Costs as defined in Paragraph 5 shall be borne by the Parties in the proportions set forth in Schedule B.
 
7.2 The O&M Costs as defined in Paragraph 6 shall be borne by the Parties in the proportions set forth in Schedule B.
 
7.3 The Terminal Parties shall each render invoices to the CBP for any O&M Costs incurred as outlined in Paragraph 6 not more frequently than
quarterly and by the tenth (10th) day of the appropriate month in accordance with procedures to be established by the F&ASC and
approved by the Management Committee.  The Party rendering an invoice shall furnish such further details of such invoice as the other
Parties may reasonably require. On the basis of such invoices, the CBP shall pay such amounts as may be owed sixty (60) days from the
10th calendar day of the month in which the invoice was rendered or on the following working day if day sixty (60) is not a working day in
the CBP’s Country.
 
7.4 The Terminal Parties shall each render invoices to the CBP for any Capital Costs incurred as outlined in Paragraph 5 (except Terminal Station
cost) not more frequently than quarterly and by the tenth (10th) day of the appropriate month in accordance with procedures to be
established by the F&ASC and approved by the Management Committee.  The Party rendering an invoice shall furnish such further details
of such invoice as the other Parties may reasonably require.  On the basis of such invoices, the CBP shall pay such amounts as may be
owed sixty (60) days from the 10th calendar day of the month in which the invoice was rendered or on the following working day if day
sixty (60) is not a working day in the CBP’s Country.
 
7.5 Unless the Management Committee authorizes changes to the procedure for the rendering of bills associated with the Capital Costs or O&M
Costs, the CBP shall promptly render bills, in accordance with this Paragraph 7 and the billing and payment procedures established by the
F&ASC and approved by the Management Committee, to each of the Parties for such Parties’ pro rata shares of these costs.  Such bills
shall be rendered by the CBP not more frequently than quarterly and shall contain a reasonable amount of detail to substantiate them.  On
the basis of such bills, each Party shall pay the CBP, such amounts as may be owed by the end of the calendar month following the
calendar month in which the bill was rendered, on the date specified by the CBP.
 
187.6 In the case of bills containing costs billed on a preliminary billing basis, appropriate adjustments will be made in subsequent bills promptly after
the actual costs involved are determined.  As soon as practicable the CBP shall make such adjustments and render such bills or arrange for
such credits as appropriate due to changes in the cost actually incurred.
 
7.7 As soon as practicable after the RFS Date, the amount of each Party’s share of the Capital Costs shall be computed by the CBP who shall make
appropriate adjustments and render any necessary bills or arrange for any necessary refunds by way of final settlement in order that each
Party may bear its proper share of the costs as provided in this Paragraph 7.
 
7.8 For purposes of this Agreement, financial charges shall be computed as applicable on a daily basis from the date payment is incurred until the
date payment is due, at a rate equal to the lowest publicly announced prime rate or minimum commercial lending rate, however described,
for 90 day loans in the currencies of the Initial Parties or the currency of billing, as applicable, charged by established commercial banks in
the countries concerned on the fifteenth day of the month in which the costs were incurred by the invoicing Parties.  If such a day is not a
business day, the rate prevailing on the next business day shall be used.  The source of the rate of such financial charges shall be as
shown at Annex 6. The application of financial charges relating to costs incurred for the APCN 2 Capital Costs and O&M Costs shall be
limited to a maximum of 120 days, unless otherwise approved by the Management Committee.
 
7.9 Amounts billed and not paid when due shall accrue extended payment charges from the day following the date on which payment was due until
paid. If the due date is not a business day, the due date shall be postponed to the next business day.  For the purpose of this Agreement,
extended payment charges shall be computed at three hundred percent (300%) of the rate described in Subparagraph 7.8 on the day
following the date payment on the bill was due.  In the event that applicable law does not allow the imposition of extended payment
charges at the rate established in accordance with this Subparagraph 7.9, extended payment charges shall be at the highest rate permitted
by applicable law, which in no event shall be higher than the rate computed in accordance with this Subparagraph 7.9.  For purposes of this
Agreement, “paid” shall mean that the funds are immediately available for use by the recipient.
 
7.10 Credits for refunds of financial charges and bills for extended payment charges shall not be rendered if the amount of charges involved is less
than the equivalent of one hundred ($100) US dollars or its equivalent in the billing currency.
 
7.11 A bill shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Party to whom it is rendered if that Party does not present a written objection on or before
the date when payment is due.  If such objection is made, the Parties concerned shall make every reasonable effort to settle promptly the
dispute concerning the bill in question.  If the objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid the disputed bill, the agreed upon
overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the objecting Party by the invoicing Party together with any financial charges
 
19calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance with Subparagraph 7.8 of this Agreement from the date of payment of the bill to the
date on which the refund is transmitted to the objecting Party.  If the objection is not sustained and the billed Party has not paid the
disputed bill, said Party will pay such bill promptly together with any extended payment charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in
accordance with Subparagraph 7.9 of this Agreement from the day following the day on which payment was due until paid.  Nothing in this
Subparagraph 7.11 shall relieve a Party from paying those parts of a bill that are not in dispute.
 
7.12 Upon the signing of this Agreement, the CBP shall render bills to the Parties for approximately five percent (5%) of their financial commitment
in APCN2 as determined by Schedule B. The exact amount of the bills and the billing procedure shall be determined by the Management
Committee. The funds received by the CBP from these bills shall be kept in an interest bearing account for the benefit of the Parties to be
maintained by the CBP and the used solely and in their entirety to pay the first invoices received by the CBP.
 
8. CURRENCY OF PAYMENT
 
All invoices rendered to the CBP shall be in the currency of the United States, or in the currency of the invoicing Party which is specified
in Annex 6 or the currency in which the cost was incurred in the case of O&M Costs.  Such invoices shall be paid in the currency in which
the invoices are rendered.  The CBP shall render bills to the Parties in the currency of the United States and be paid in the same currency.  In
conjunction with the CBP, the F&ASC shall develop procedures to deal with the differences between the exchange rates in the
circumstances when the currency of invoices rendered to the CBP is not the currency of the United States.

9.3 The PG shall ensure that the Supply Contract requires the Supplier to obtain from their contractors and subcontractors such supporting records,
for other than the cost of fixed cost items, as may be reasonably required by Subparagraph 9.1 and to keep and maintain such records for a
period of five (5) years from the RFPA Date of the Wet Segment, as specified in the Supply Contract.
 
209.4 The PG shall ensure that the Supply Contract shall afford the Parties to this Agreement the right to review the books, records, vouchers, and

Segment T and such portion of Segment S, in efficient working order.
 
10.2 The Terminal Parties (for the purposes of this Paragraph 10, collectively called the “Maintenance Authorities” and each individual called a
“Maintenance Authority” or “MA”), shall be jointly responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Wet Segment and shall use all
reasonable efforts to maintain economically the Wet Segment in efficient working order and with an objective of achieving effective and

such Assignee, and shall not negate any of the obligations of the Assignor.  If the Assignor is an Initial Party, then the Initial Party status

portion of the APCN 2
 
33The aforementioned provision shall not be used to circumvent the provisions under Paragraph 12.

23. DEFAULT

one (1) month after the payment due date, the CBP shall notify the billed Party and also the Management Committee in writing of the status
of the matter and will request the reclamation of capacity, as provided for in this Paragraph 23, if full payment is not received within two (2)
months of such notification.  If full payment is not received within such specified period, the Management Committee may reclaim the
Capacity in the APCN 2 allocated to the billed Party.

whether or not to reclaim the capacity assigned to such billed Party.  If the Management Committee nevertheless reclaims any capacity in
the APCN 2 assigned to such defaulting Party, the defaulting Party shall not be entitled to any payment or credit for the reclaimed
capacity. The Management Committee shall determine arrangements for disposition of any reclaimed capacity.  All rights of a defaulting
Party under this Agreement shall terminate as of the time all its capacity in the APCN 2 is reclaimed by the Management Committee; and
concurrent with such reclamation of capacity, the defaulting Party will no longer be deemed to be a Party to this Agreement.  Such
reclamation shall not relieve the defaulting Party from its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to the payment of its
unpaid accounts, which have been incurred prior to the actual reclamation.  The defaulting Party is not entitled to any reimbursement of
any amounts it had paid under this Agreement.  In such circumstances, the Schedules shall be revised to reflect the default of a Party and
the reallocation of interests pursuant to the arrangements determined by the Management Committee.
 
23.3 Notwithstanding Subparagraph 23.2, reclamation of a Terminal Party’s capacity will not release the Terminal Party from providing, operating
and maintaining its respective Terminal Station until a reasonable agreement is negotiated in order to ensure the continuous operation of
the said Terminal Party’s Terminal Station after reclamation of its capacity.

hereunder shall not thereafter be
 
34construed as a waiver of any breach or default, or as a waiver of any such provision, right, or privilege hereunder.

against any cost, loss, liability, or expense (including attorney's fees)
arising out of any breach of D2's warranties hereunder, or out of third party
claims against LICENSEE alleging that the Licensed Technology, or LICENSEE's use
or distribution of the Licensed Technology as set forth in this Agreement,
infringes any third party's patent, trade secret, copyright of other
intellectual property right in any country, provided that LICENSEE shall (i)
notify D2 promptly in writing of such claims, and (ii) give D2 sole control of
the defense or settlement of such claims. D2 shall not be liable for any claims
to the extent that such claims arise out of the LICENSEE's unauthorized
modifications of the Licensed Technology, and not out of the Licensed Technology
as delivered by D2 to LICENSEE. If the Licensed Technology, or any part thereof,
is

adjudicatively determined to be, or in either party's reasonable opinion will
be, the subject of any claim, suit or proceeding for infringement of any third
party's patent, copyright or trade secret in any country, or if the distribution
of use of the Licensed Technology is enjoined, then D2 may, at D2's sole option
and expense, (i) obtain for LICENSEE and its distributors, resellers and
customers the right to distribute or use the Licensed Technology under such
third party patents, trade secrets, copyrights or other intellectual property
rights, or (ii) replace the Licensed Technology with other software of
equivalent or superior functionality, or (iii) suitably modify the Licensed
Technology to avoid such infringement. In the event that D2 is unable to carry
out the options set forth in (i), (ii) and (iii) of the proceeding sentence, at
the option of Licensee D2 may terminate this Agreement and refund all amounts
paid by LICENSEE to D2 hereunder; provided, that such termination shall have no
effect on the rights of end users to use LICENSEE products, incorporating anyLicensed Technology, which were acquired by such end users prior to such
termination.

Detailed Signal Processing Algorithm Specification
A.1      HDLC Communications
Not included as Licensed Technology.
A.2      Voice Activity Detection
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) detects voice activity, adapts to background
ambient or line noise as well as the presence of echo, classifies voice activity
as "early" versus "sustained", and assigns an "effort level" to the speaker that
is independent of network loss.This module is used to detect voice activity in the CP Detect state.
A.2.1    Functional requirements:
The Voice Activity Detector discriminates voice activity generated by a caller
from background noise (acoustic and line noise) as well as echo and sidetones
reflected back to the receive voice path. It also provides an "effort level"
quantity that indicates the level of effort of the caller. The functional and
performance requirements are specified to cover a wide range of applications,
such as voice activated recordings (as in voice messaging), outbound call
classification, digital speech interpolation (DSI), and voice conferencing.
1.       The Voice Activity Detector classifies every block of voice data (8 ms
         long) as "port active" (early detect), "speaker active" (port
         sustained), and "not active".
2.       It provides a measurement that approximates the level of effort exerted
         by the caller. Such an approximation is made by normalizing the short
         term RMS of the voice signal by a longer term RMS value. The "effort
         level" varies between -32 dB and 31 dB, and is at 0 dB when the speaker
         is speaking at his/her "normal" level.
3.       The Voice Activity Detector adapts to background noise up to -24 dBm.
         Adaptation is 200 ms when the noise level drops, and is approximately
         1000 ms when noise rises.
4.       The Voice Activity Detector screens out sidetone or echo as speech up
         to an ERL of -26 dB.

and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL
   21
A.2.2    Performance Requirements:
The accuracy of the voice Activity detector is measured by the rate of "false
detection" (i.e. classifying noise or echo as voice activity) and "clipping"
(i.e. classifying voice activity as noise or echo) under different ambient noise
and echo conditions. "Port active" detection under different ambient noise
conditions:
1.       No perceptible clipping at quiet to modest noise levels of -50 dBm to
         -40 dBm with nominal levels of speech activity (-20 dBm average power
         over 2 seconds of speech). No more than 5% of voice onsets is clipped
         for noisy conditions (noise level from -40 dBm to -30 dBm).
2.       No more than 1% of "silence" periods is detected as speech for the
         modest noise condition. No more than 2% of "silence" is detected as
         port active for noisy conditions.
3.       The performance goals above is met when noise levels change during the
         test.
"Speaker active" detection under different ambient noise conditions:
1.       Speech activity that lasts more than tSUSTAIN is detected as
         "Sustained" or "Speaker Active".
2.       The clipping requirements is better than "Port Activity" detection.
         Fewer than 0.5% of onsets/hour (2.5 per hour) for modest noise
         condition (-45 dBm) and fewer than 2% (10 per hour) for high noise
         condition (-35 dBm) have perceptible clipping.
3.       False detection performance (i.e., detecting noise as "speaker active")
         exceeds those of "port activity" due to tSUSTAIN criteria. No more than
         1% (36 seconds per hour) of noise segments is misclassified as
         "sustained" for modest noise conditions, and no more than 2% (72
         seconds per hour) of "silence" is detected as port active for noisy
         conditions.
"Port active" and "Speaker active" detection in the presence of echo:
1.       Less than 1% of residual echo is detected as "port active" - (i.e. 36
         sec. per hour) during normal operation of canceller.
2.       Less than 0.1 % (i.e. 3.6 sec per hour) of residual echo is detected as
         "speaker active" or "port sustained" during normal operation of
         canceller.
3.       Clipping of input speech in the presence of echo is no higher than
         clipping in the presence of modest to high level of noise.

Table A-1 specifies the nominal frequencies for the DTMF digits that must be
detected.

         --------------------------------------------------------------
                       Table A-1: Nominal DTMF Frequencies
1.       Detect the presence of all 16 DTMF digits that are produced by
         different phones on the market under a broad range of network
         conditions.
2.       DTMF digit information is provided as soon as the minimum duration is
         met. This information is called leading edge detection. This allows the
         earliest possible response to the digit, such as stopping voice output.
3.       The trailing edge of a DTMF digit must be detected. This allows the
         system to delay any response (such as playing out voice) to the digit
         until the user has released the DTMF key. The criteria selected for
         trailing edge detection will debounce DTMF digits.
4.       The DSP reports leading and trailing edge in the 8 ms block that they
         are detected.  DTMF events are not buffered.
A.3.2    Performance requirements:
Table A-2 consists of performance requirements taken from EIA-464A and Bellcore
TR-TSY-000181. Also shown is D2's DTMF performance requirements, which is a
superset of the EIA and Bellcore requirements.

Other performance requirements:
1.       A leading edge of DTMF digit is signaled during the block in which the
         minimum duration is met, and the trailing edge is signaled during the
         block in which the minimum debounce interval is met.
2.       Talk-down: DTMF detection must work reliably in the presence of echo
         (for the maximum allowable output voice level) and with varying levels
         of DTMF signals (due to network loss). D2's DTMF detector combined with
         the echo must meet the performance requirements of Figure A-I in the
         presence echo generated by playing pause-removed voice (male and
         female) at - 18 dBm ASL (averaged over 3 seconds) over a telephone
         circuit with 15 dB echo return loss (ERL).

3.       Debounce test: Long tones (generated by "hard" key presses) must not be
         detected as multiple tones in the presence of echo interference or line
         noise. Combined with the echo canceller, the DTMF detector is required
         to reliably "debounce" all DTMF digits above -18 dBm in the presence of
         voice levels below -15 dBm (ASL) and a telephone circuit with echo
         return loss (ERL) of 15 dB.

4.       Double-talk talk-off: Many voice processing hardware or semiconductor
         manufacturers significantly degrade the "talk-off' performance of their
         detector in the presence of voice echo or sidetone to achieve a high
         level of talk-down performance. This strategy is acceptable in a pure
         digit-in-voice-out scenario, but for voice conferencing or voice
         recognition applications, voice could be present in the both the
         transmit and receive path. In such cases, the DTMF detector must be
         very robust against "talk-off" in double-talk situations. The talk-off
         requirements for D2's DTMF detector under double-talk is fewer than 66
         talkoffs for the Bellcore talk-off tape.
A.4      Tone Generation
The tone generation module can be programmed to generate any single, dual or
amplitude modulated tone required to meet international telecommunications
specifications. This functionality is provided by the GENF module, which
produces the sum or product of two independently generated sine waves as its
output. Each sine wave can be individually parameterized.
A.4.l    Functional requirements:
The GENF module is designed to generate a wide range of DTMF, Call Progress
Signals, MF Rl/R2, and miscellaneous tones. In order to meet or exceed
international telecommunication specifications, GENF must meet or exceed the
following functional requirements.
1.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for each frequency for dual
         tones that GENF generates. Single tones are generated by specifying
         that one of the dual tone's frequencies is 0 Hz.
2.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for the carrier and modulation
         frequencies for amplitude modulated tones that GENF generates.
3.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the frequency of a tone to be
         set in the range of 0 to 4000 Hz in 1 Hz units.
4.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the output power to be set in
         the range of +3 to -50 dBm in 0.5 dB steps.
5.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow an amplitude modulated tone's
         modulation percentage to be set in the range of 0 to 300% in 1% units.
6.       The tone duration (make time) shall be specified in 1 ms units. Tone
         durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to 8191 ms.

7.       An unlimited tone duration shall be specified by setting the make
         duration to -1.
8.       The silence duration between tones (break time) shall be specified in 1
         ms units. Silence durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to
         8191 ms.
9.       An unlimited silence duration shall be specified by setting the make
         duration to -1 and setting both frequencies of a dual tone to 0 Hz.
10.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed
         EIA/TIA-464 requirement for DTMF and call progress tone generation.
11.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed
         CCITT Blue Book Volume VI Fascicle VI.4 recommendations Q.310-Q.490
         requirements for MF R1 and R2 tone generation.
12.      The GENF module shall generate tones with one to three unique cadence
         pairs (on/off pairs).
A.4.2    Performance Requirements
1.       Frequency accuracy shall exceed 1 Hz.
2.       Level accuracy shall exceed 0.5 dB.
3.       Timing information shall exceed 1 ms accuracy.
A.5      Universal Tone Detector
A.5.l    Overview
The Universal Tone Detector (UTD) is a high configurable tone detector. By
changing parameters, this algorithm can classify a wide range of single and dual
tone call progress signals generated in a wide variety of countries.
A.5.2    General
Since different tones need different detection heuristics, and tones may have
multiple specifications, each tone is tagged with a tone category identifier.

                           Table A-3: Tone Categories
In addition to specifying a tone category, the parameters include a value that
is returned to the application when the tone is detected. This parameter need
not be unique. This allows multiple specifications to report the same tone event
to the application. UTD is table driven. Using this approach, the tone detector
searches parameter tables for a matching tone. When a tone matches, the tone
code determines the heuristics necessary to completely classify the tone. Also,
the tones must be specified in a way that a set of parameters corresponds to
either a single tone, a dual tone, or an amplitude modulated tone.

A.5.3    General Functional Requirements
UTD functionally combines a single tone detector and a dual/modulated tone
detector into a single module. UTD combines the results of these detectors into
a single result. UTD has the following requirements.
1.       The DSP shall indicate that the first ringback has started after at
         least 400 ms of ringback like signal has been processed, as long as no
         other tone type is early detected. If more than one type of tone is
         early detected, the first ringback reporting shall be delayed until
         either cadence information disqualifies the other types, or tone
         precedence is used as a 'tie-breaker'.Software License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc.
and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL
   28
2.       The DSP shall indicate ringback has stopped when ringback is no longer
         detected.
3.       The DSP shall indicate a busy tone has been detected after the
         requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and
         no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.
4.       The DSP shall indicate a reorder tone has been detected after the
         requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and
         no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.
5.       The DSP shall indicate a number unobtainable tone has been detected
         after the requisite number of make and break intervals have been
         processed, and no other tone category is still a candidate for
         detection.
6.       In the event that more than one tone is a candidate for detection,
         detection is delayed until all characteristics that may disqualify any
         of the candidates are tested (for example, waiting for multiple cadence
         pairs to occur). If there is still more than one potential tone after
         all differentiating features have been exhausted, then the tone with
         the highest precedence is detected. Also, if the tone ceases prior to
         singling out one candidate tone, then the tone with the highest
         precedence is detected. Precedence is shown in Table A-3.
7.       The DSP shall supply an early detect flag. This flag shall be valid
         after the detector has processed no more than 72 ms of a tone. If more
         than one tone category is early detected, then the early detect flag
         shall indicate the tone category with the highest precedence.
8.       The DSP shall indicate that a modem has been detected if a single tone
         falls within the specified frequencies for modem tones, the minimum
         make interval has been exceeded while the average tone power is in
         excess of the minimum power requirement, and no other tone category is
         still a candidate for detection.
9.       The DSP shall indicate that a FAX CNG tone has been detected if a
         single tone falls within the specified frequencies for a CNG tone, the
         requisite number of on/off cadences have been processed, and no other
         tone category is still a candidate for detection.
10.      The DSP shall indicate that a SIT tone has been detected if at least
         two of the three segments of possible SIT tones have been detected for
         at least the minimum interval in excess of the minimum power
         requirement.

11.      The DSP shall indicate that an Unknown tone has been detected when it
         has been determined that a tone has been detected that falls within the
         specified frequencies for an Unknown tone, the minimum duration has
         been exceeded, and the tone does not match and other category tones.
A.5.3.1 TONE DETECTOR PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
A.5.3.1.1 Single Tones
There are four types of parameters that shall be used to control single tone
detection. The variation of each parameter shall be limited by the constraints
listed in Table A-5.

The frequency detection range shall be specified the Frequency and Bandwidth
parameters. Figure A-2 shows the relationship of these parameters. Note that the
bandwidth specification is symmetric about the center frequency. The Frequency
and Bandwidth parameters define a "must detect" range. The detector shall not
use frequency criteria to reject any tones which are within the range specified
Frequency/Bandwidth parameters. Tones whose frequencies are outside but close to
frequency range may be detected.

            Single Tone
If the Power Level of the detected parameter is greater than the minimum power
specified by the parameters, the signal shall not be rejected by Power Level
heuristics. Duration parameters are used to set the allowable duration of a
tone. Minimum and maximum tone durations may be specified (make durations).
Also, minimum and maximum silence durations between tones may be specified.
A.5.3.1.2         Dual Tones
Dual tones are created by summing two sinusoids. Since each tone can be isolated
in the frequency domain, dual tones are specified as a pair of single tones.
Parameters for each tone of a dual pair use the same constraints as single
tones. Namely, frequency1 is the center frequency of the lower tone, and
bandwidth1 specifies its frequency tolerance. The same is true for frequency2
and bandwidth2 for the high tone. Figure A-3 shows the definition of the
frequency and bandwidth parameters for a dual tone.

Not all dual tones are detectable by UTD. A dual tone shall detected only when
the difference between the two component frequencies is greater than 10 Hz and
less than 230Hz.
A.5.3.1.3         Amplitude Modulated Tones
Amplitude modulated tones are created by multiplying two sinusoids. When
analyzed in the frequency domain, a modulated tone looks like three tones.
Figure A-4 shows the frequency spectrum for a modulated tone.
The tone whose frequency is the average of the other tones is the carrier. The
other two tones can be referred to as side lobes. For amplitude modulated tones,
frequencyl and bandwidth1 specify the low sidelobe and its tolerance, while
frequency2 and bandwidth2 specify the high sidelobe and its tolerance.

         Figure A-4: Frequency Domain Representation of Tone Parameters
                         for an Amplitude Modulated Tone
As with dual tones, not all modulated tones will be detected by UTD. Modulated
tones shall be detected if the difference between the carrier frequency and the
sidelobes is between 10 Hz and 230 Hz.
A.5.3.l.4         Precedence
By assigning a detection precedence to the classification process, tone
frequency ranges can overlap. When a tone's parameters fall into a range shared
by two or more signals, the signal is classified as the one with the highest
precedence.

                      Table A-6: Tone Detection Precedence
Table A-6 shows the precedence of typical tones that the UTD module detects.
Modem signals have the highest precedence, and Unknown tones have the lowest.
Therefore, the frequency range of unknown tones can safely overlap the other
tone ranges without causing tones to be misclassified. If the range for Unknown
tones is allowed to be the maximum range allowed by the detector, any detected
tone that is unclassified would be designated as Unknown.

Performance Requirements:
1.       Frequency Deviation: Even though the generator is required to meet a
         frequency tolerance per tone of +/-0.5%, the detector needs to allow
         for a wider frequency tolerance due to variations in generators and
         line distortions. The CP detector detects all tones whose component
         frequencies deviate less than 1% from nominal.
2.       Twist: The CP detector detects all tones whose twist is less than +/-4
         dB.
3.       Dynamic Range:  The CP detector exhibits a minimum dynamic range of 
         25 dB.
4.       Cadence: The CP detector must detect call progress tones whose cadence
         is within +/-10%.
5.       Talkoff: The CP detector makes no false detections in 12 hours of
         testing with voice at -15 to -18 dBm ASL.
A.5.3.1.6         FAX CNG Tone Detection
The standard connection protocol for automatic connection of a FAX modem
requires that the calling FAX modem generate a calling tone (CNG). Hence for
incoming calls, the EVP software has to detect a CNG signal. When CNG is
detected, EVP alerts the Core Processor to redirect the call to a FAX machine or
a FAX modem embedded within the call processing system.

         connected to a local CO with a noise level of less than -45 dBm.
3.       The detector misses less than 0.5% of CNG signals (generated at -10
         dBm) when compressed voice is output at a level of-15 dBm or less
         (average over 3 seconds) into a network whose ERL is greater than 15
         dB.
4.       The detector does not falsely detect more than 1 CNG tone per 5 hours
         of voice (based on Bellcore recorded talk radio voice tapes.)
A.5.3.1.7         Modem Tone Specification
All answering modems that conform to the ITU V.25 answering sequence present a
2100 Hz tone 1.8 to 2.5 seconds after answering the telephone line. Figure A-6

cancellers and echo suppressors from the network. According to ITU G.164, phase
reversal shall be accomplished such that the phase is within 180 +/-10 degrees
in 1 ms and that the amplitude of the 2100 Hz tone is not more than 3 dB below

4.       The detector does not falsely detect the presence of a modem answer
         tone more than once per 5 hours of voice (using Bellcore recorded talk
         radio voice tapes).

         seconds, there shall be less than 1 talkoff in 1800 calls.
A.5.3.1.8         Three Tone Sequences
Most countries that generate Special Information Tones (SIT) use a three tone
sequence. SIT sequences are generated by various central offices or common
carrier switching points to indicate a problem with the dialed call. A SIT tone
sequence generally precedes a recorded voice announcement such as "the number
you have dialed is no longer in service..." and is provided specifically for the
purpose of detection of the problem type by an automated device.
There are two popular types of SIT sequences. The first type is used mainly in
Europe. It consists of a sequence of three tones of identical durations. The
second type is the one used in North America. There are several North American
SIT sequences that are encoded using various combinations of frequency and
duration for each of the three tones. The encoding has been standardized by
Bellcore.
Performance Requirements:
1.       The UTD shall handle both types of sequences.
2.       There is no talkdown performance requirement. The near end is always
         silent and does not interfere with far end SIT signals.

         each voice call is has an average of 2 seconds of voice, there shall be
         fewer than 1 talkoff in 9000 calls.
A.5.3.1.9         Unknown Tone
Any single tone, dual tone, amplitude modulated tone or single tone sequence
that is not classified as a CP, SIT, CNG or modem ANS tone, shall be reported as
an unknown tone.
Performance Requirements:

2.       There shall be fewer than 1 talkoff in 5 hours of voice when the
         detector is programmed with the recommended parameters (minimum tone

         seconds of voice, there shall be fewer than 1 talkoff in 9000 calls.

1.       Be configurable to detect either R1, R2 forward, or R2 backward MF
         digits on a per-call basis.
2.       Detect the presence of all 15 R1, 15 R2 Forward, and 15 R2 Backward
         digits under a broad range of network conditions.
3.       MF digit information is provided as soon as the minimum duration is
         met. This information is called leading edge detection. This allows the
         earliest possible response to the digit, such as in compelled
         signaling.
4.       The trailing edge of a MF digit must be detected. This allows the
         system to delay any response (such as in compelled signaling) to the
         digit until it is removed. The criteria selected for trailing edge
         detection will debounce MF digits.
5.       The DSP reports leading and trailing edge in the 8 ms block that they
         are detected. MF events are not buffered.

If LICENSEE commits to purchase licenses for a minimum of 10,000 processors for
the first year after first customer shipments, the fee_per_port will be reduced
for $1.00 for the first 5,000 processors.
The SRM will provide 5 Basic Services and simple conferencing (which does not
require network echo cancellation):
         1.     DTG -- Digital Tone Generation (static channels and outpulsing)
         2.     CPA -- Call Progress Analysis (with Voice Activity Detection)
         3.-    DRC -- DTMF Detection
         4.     MFR(1) -- Multifrequency Reception (1)
         5.     MFCR2 -- Multifrequency Reception and Transmission, Compelled R2
To determine the Average ports per DSP, the completed software will be tested in
a heavily-loaded VCO/20 to determine the maximum number of ports that a single
DSP processor performing each of the Basic Services can reliably satisfy.  This

maximum will be documented in Table 2 below, and will be encoded in software, to
prevent a customer from exceeding it.
This maximum will vary depending on the DSP processor speed, so a separate
measurement will have to be done for SRMs containing faster processors. Due to
system limitations, this number will never exceed 63.
The number of ports supported for each of the Basic Services, per DSP processor,
will be averaged (arithmetic mean) to create an average number of ports per DSP
(Average_Ports_per_DSP). Because of the computational simplicity of the DTG
Service, it will not be included in this calculation:

THIS OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of the latest date referenced on the signature page below (the “Effective Date”), by and between Solar Tax Partners 1, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Owner”), and Solar Power, Inc. (“Service Provider”). Owner and Service Provider are sometimes hereinafter referred to individually as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”  
RECITALS  
A. Owner operates a solar energy facility (the “SEF”), and more particularly defined in Exhibit A hereto on the premises (the “Premises”) described in Exhibit B hereto for the purposes of providing electric power to the Owner’s host customer, Aerojet — Rancho Cordova, CA (the “User”);  
B. Owner desires to retain the services of Service Provider to operate and manage the SEF and provide scheduled maintenance of the SEF, and Service Provider is willing to perform such services upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  
AGREEMENT  
In consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual agreements, representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Owner and Service Provider agree as follows:  
ARTICLE 1. RESPONSIBILITIES OF SERVICE PROVIDER  
1.1 Appointment of Service Provider.  
(a) Owner hereby appoints Service Provider, and Service Provider hereby accepts the appointment, to perform the SEF operations and maintenance services (“Services”) on behalf of Owner as of the Services Commencement Date as further described in Exhibit C hereto in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Service Provider shall perform the Services and its obligations under this Agreement, and act at all times as an independent Service Provider of Owner. None of Service Provider’s employees shall be, or shall be considered to be, employees of Owner. Service Provider shall be fully responsible for the payment of all wages, salaries, benefits and other compensation to its employees. This Agreement is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, and neither Party shall be or constitute, or be deemed or construed to be or constitute, under any circumstances or for any purpose whatsoever, a partner, joint venturer, agent (except as specifically provided in this Agreement) or legal representative of the other Party, and the Parties expressly disclaim any intention to create a partnership, joint venture, association or other such relationship. Neither Party is granted any right or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other Party, or to bind the other Party in any manner (except as specifically provided in this Agreement).  
1.2 Performance of Maintenance Services. Service Provider shall perform the maintenance portion of the Services in a clean, safe, efficient and environmentally reasonable manner and maintain the SEF in good operating and mechanical condition in accordance with this Agreement and (i) all applicable laws and permits, (ii) all applicable express warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers, suppliers, or Service Providers who provided materials or labor under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement dated September 30, 2009 (the “EPC Agreement”) for the SEF subject to the terms and limitations thereof, and (iii) all manufacturer’s maintenance instructions and specifications.  
1.3 Performance Objectives. Service Provider shall perform the Services and its obligations under this Agreement in a manner that (a) insures the operation of the SEF within all required operational parameters and requirements, (b) preserves all warranties provided by manufacturers, suppliers, or Service Providers who provided materials or labor under the EPC Agreement relating to the SEF, subject to Force Majeure, (c) maintains the SEF, and  
1(d) seeks to minimize the variable operating costs of and wear and tear on the SEF, including using commercially reasonable efforts to achieve industry standard levels of SEF availability.  
1.4 Non-Covered Services.  
(a) The Services shall not include, and Service Provider shall not be responsible for, any operations, maintenance, repair, or other services beyond the Services set forth in Exhibit C (such non-covered services referred to hereinafter as “Non-Covered Services”). All work associated with Non-Covered Services will be billed according to the terms of Section 2.2. Any studies or other services required by Owner to review options to optimize system performance will be provided as Non-Covered Services.  
(b) The Performance of any Non-Covered Services by Service Provider shall require a written request from Owner specifying the Non-Covered Services to be performed by Service Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the costs of Non-Covered Services to be performed by Service Provider do not exceed $500.00 in any single instance, or (ii) the Non-Covered Services are provided by Service Provider on an emergency basis to prevent an imminent danger of injury, loss, or damage (exceeding $500.00), Service Provider shall attempt to notify Owner via telephone prior to the performance of any Non-Covered Services and shall be authorized to proceed with the performance of such Non-Covered Services upon receiving verbal approval from Owner. Should Service Provider be unable to contact Owner prior to providing any Non-Covered Services on an emergency basis, Service Provider shall be authorized to perform such emergency Non-Covered Services without prior approval from Owner and shall notify Owner immediately thereafter in writing specifying the nature of the emergency and the Non-Covered Services provided.  
(c) Service Provider shall perform any Non-Covered Services only to the extent Service Provider is capable of, and licensed to, provide such Non-Covered Services and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  
1.5 Permits. Service Provider shall identify, procure, obtain, maintain and comply with all permits that may be required under applicable laws for or in connection with the performance of Services (and Non-Covered Services as actually provided by Service Provider) and that need to be procured, obtained and maintained by or in the name of Service Provider. Owner shall provide Service Provider with such assistance and cooperation as may reasonably be required in order to obtain and maintain all such Permits. Service Provider shall submit copies of all applications for, and proposed forms of, all such Permits to Owner with sufficient time to allow for Owner’s review and approval.  
1.6 Cooperation with Other Service Providers. Service Provider acknowledges that Owner has retained, and may from time to time retain, other Service Providers to provide maintenance, administrative and management services for Owner in connection with the SEF or otherwise at the Premises. Service Provider shall cooperate and coordinate its activities hereunder with such other Service Providers. Service Provider shall not be responsible in any way for any services provided by other Service Providers retained by Owner. Owner shall instruct all other Service Providers to coordinate the performance of services with Service Provider so as to not interfere with Service Provider’s performance of Services.  
1.7 Personnel Standards.  
(a) Service Provider’s employees shall be qualified (and if required by applicable law, licensed, certified or registered) and experienced in the functions to which they are assigned and shall meet the requirements of all permits, all applicable laws and the then-current SEF maintenance manuals (to the extent copies of which have been provided to Service Provider by Owner). If requested, Service Provider shall provide to Owner evidence of the competence of such personnel including details of their previous experience and qualifications. If Owner or User reasonably determines an employee of Service Provider to be under-qualified, disruptive, non-cooperative or otherwise undesirable at the Premises, Owner or User may request the immediate removal of such employee from the Premises for any existing or future delivery of the Services and the replacement of such employee with a different employee of Service Provider; provided that Owner or User, as the case may be, will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonable notice to Service Provider of the need for such proposed removal. Neither Owner’s or User’s request to Service Provider to remove an employee, nor Service Provider’s removal of an employee following Owner’s or User’s request, shall relieve Service Provider of any of its obligations hereunder or be construed as a waiver by Owner or User of any of its rights under this Agreement.

Service Provider shall institute policies that require post-accident and for-cause drug or alcohol testing.

2by Owner, within ten (10) business days following such request. Service Provider shall make the SEF O&M Reports available to Owner in hard copy and electronic formats.  
(b) Service Provider shall prepare reports and data related to the maintenance of hazardous materials introduced on-site by the Service Provider at the SEF in a manner complying with all applicable laws.

(a) In the event that Service Provider provides any Non-Covered Services (or any other services not included within the scope of the Services), Service Provider shall submit an invoice and Owner shall compensate Service Provider for such services per the Billing Rate Schedule in Exhibit D. Third party services will be billed directly to Owner by the applicable third party and shall be paid by Owner directly in a timely manner.

The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall not apply to information within any one of the following categories or any combination thereof: (1) information that was in the public domain prior to the receiving Party’s receipt or that subsequently becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, except by the receiving party’s wrongful act; (2) information that the receiving Party can demonstrate was in its possession prior to receipt thereof from the disclosing Party and not otherwise subject to an obligation of confidentiality; or (3) information received by a Party from a third party having no obligation of secrecy with respect thereof.

(a) Service Provider shall not, without the prior written consent of Owner, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, assign, pledge or transfer all or any part of, or any right or obligation under, this Agreement, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, and any such assignment or transfer without such consent will be null and void; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Service Provider may, without the consent of Owner, assign,  
5pledge or transfer all or any part of Service Provider’s payment rights under this Agreement (i) to any affiliate of Service Provider, (ii) to any party that acquires Service Provider or all or substantially all of Service Provider’s assets, or (iii) for security purposes in connection with any financing and, provided further, that Service Provider shall remain fully liable for the performance of all of Service Provider’s obligations under this Agreement. Service Provider shall deliver notice of any such assignment, pledge or transfer to Owner in writing as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Owner agrees to execute such reasonable consents to assignment and other documents, and to provide such information, as is reasonably requested by Service Provider in connection with any such assignment, pledge or transfer. Any payment made by Owner to Service Provider after the effective date of such assignment, pledge or transfer and within ten (10) business days after receipt of Service Provider’s written notice, shall be deemed payment to the assignee, pledgee, or transferee identified in Service Provider’s notice. In addition, Service Provider may subcontract any or all of its duties hereunder, but no such subcontract shall relieve Service Provider of any such subcontracted duties  
(b) Owner may, without the consent of Service Provider, assign, pledge or transfer all or any part of, or any right or obligation under this Agreement (i) to any affiliate of Owner (including any affiliate of Owner’s manager), (ii) to any party that acquires Owner or all or substantially all of Owner’s assets, (iii) to User, or (iv) for security purposes in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements regarding the SEF, provided, however, that Owner shall remain fully liable as a guarantor for all of its payment obligations under this Agreement. Owner shall deliver notice of any such assignment, pledge or transfer to Service Provider in writing as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Service Provider agrees to execute such reasonable consents to assignment and other documents, and to provide such information, as is reasonably requested by Owner in connection with any such assignment, pledge or transfer.  
(c) Subject to the foregoing restrictions on assignment, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  
9.2 Cooperation with Financing. Service Provider acknowledges that Owner will be financing the acquisition of the SEF and Service Provider agrees that it shall reasonably cooperate with Owner and its financing parties in connection with such financing for the SEF, including the furnishing of such information and the giving of such certificates; provided that the foregoing undertaking shall not obligate Service Provider to materially change any rights or benefits, or materially increase any burdens, liabilities or obligations of Service Provider, under this Agreement (except for providing notices and additional cure periods to the financing parties with respect to Events of Defaults with respect to Owner as a financing party may reasonably request).  
ARTICLE 10. MISCELLANEOUS

Each Party shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for its performance obligations hereunder arising from Force Majeure.

This Agreement is entered into this 31 January, 1994 by and between SAGEM

Software Maintenance.
                                  WITNESSETH
WHEREAS, XIMAGE and MORPHO have signed the "ForceField PSS Agreement" for the
purchase of services and the use of Software referred to hereafter as the
ForceField PSS System.
WHEREAS, XIMAGE has granted to MORPHO a perpetual and non-exclusive license,
transferable only to the Kuwait Government and solely for use with the PSS to
be installed and used as a portrait storage system in connection with the
AFIS sold to the Kuwait Government in Kuwait.
1.    DEFINITIONS
The terms defined in this Section shall have the meaning as follows:FIRST LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means MORPHO will require the Kuwait Government to
contact MORPHO maintenance personnel for all problems associated with the
installed Force Field PSS System. MORPHO will respond with fixes and/or
workarounds to keep the system operational. MORPHO personnel may document any
software problems and refer them to XIMAGE for additional fixes or patches.
SECOND LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means if Morpho's personnel can not start or keep
the system operational because of software problems, XIMAGE should be
contacted to provide all documented and replicated software Errors. XIMAGE
will make best efforts to support Morpho by any means available. Such an
undertaking is made in the knowledge that a telecommunications line between
the site and XIMAGE may not be in existance.
PROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the
Sybase and Focus software and includes all software provided under the
Maintenance Agreement.
PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications published by XIMAGE for a
particular version of the Program (if no such specification is available,
then the relevant documentation for a particular version of the Program).
EFFECTIVE DATE shall mean the Date of Installation of the PSS in Kuwait, i.e.
December 10, 1993.
ERROR means any material failure to operate in accordance with the program
specifications delivered from the specifications appended to the base
agreement. Error includes malfunctions and defects.
                                                                        Page 3
2.   TERM OF AGREEMENT
     XIMAGE's obligations hereunder shall become effective upon the
     "Effective Date" and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall
     remain in full force and effect for at least one year thereafter. This
     Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive one (1) year terms
     at XIMAGE's then prevailing rates at the end of each one (1) year term
     unless either party gives at least sixty (60) days prior written notice
     of the non-renewal of this Agreement.
3.   SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICES
     XIMAGE will provide to MORPHO during the term hereof "Software
     Maintenance Services" which shall include remedial maintenance service
     (i.e, error fixing and/or work arounds) for any significant error,
     malfunction or defect (collectively in "Error") in the Software so that
     the Software will operate in accordance with the specifications set
     forth in the related documentation. Correction of Errors is subject to
     MORPHO's prompt notification to XIMAGE of the nature and description of
     the Error provided that the Error is not caused by the abuse, misuse or
     neglect of the products by MORPHO. In addition, XIMAGE will provide the
     following as additional Customer Support Services:
     (a)  telephone support as reasonably requested by MORPHO at the rate of
          $100 per hour for all hours in excess of 40 hours in any one-year
          term;
     (b)  on-site visits to MORPHO's sites as determined to be necessary by
          Morpho for Error correction, unless error correction is normally
          performed via Dial up from the XImage facility in San Jose;
     (c)  give title to all modifications and improvements to the PSS
          Software which XIMAGE generally makes available to its other
          customers (at no additional Charge) under standard software
          maintenance agreements relating to the Software.
If MORPHO requests XIMAGE to perform any other services, the related terms
and conditions shall be based on further separate agreement between the
parties. This Agreement and the rights and duties contained herein are not be
deemed to cover maintenance services with respect to hardware. Such may be
decided in accordance with paragraph 9.
4.   PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES
     When XIMAGE provides Software Maintenance Services which require the use
     of the hardware portion of equipment which utilizes the Software (the
     "Equipment"), MORPHO shall make such Equipment available to XIMAGE at and
     for reasonable times, and in no event will MORPHO charge XIMAGE for such
     use of such Equipment. All Software Maintenance Services covered by the
     Maintenance Charges will be performed during the regular business hours
     of XIMAGE (Monday-Friday, exclusive holidays). If Software Maintenance
     Services are performed outside regular business hours, MORPHO will pay
     the additional charges, if any, as at XIMAGES then current charges.
                                                                       Page 45.   CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS AND WARRANTIES
     The obligations of XIMAGE to provide Software Maintenance Services are

     respective operating manuals and recommended procedures, and causing

     including selecting a site which complies with the environmental
     requirements suggested by the manufacturer of the Equipment or XIMAGE

     year of maintenance. MORPHO shall pay all charges under this Agreement,
     including the total Annual Maintenance Charge, within thirty (30) days
     after receipt of a valid invoice from XIMAGE. Thereafter, the then
     applicable Annual Maintenance Charge shall be invoiced to, and paid by
     MORPHO prior to the beginning of the next annual maintenance period. All
     other charges under this Agreement shall be invoiced by XIMAGE and shall
     be due and payable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice.

          public domain;
                                                                       Page 5

     $2,000. Hourly rate for intervention is $125.00 (one hundred and twenty

     Following any intervention on site XIMAGE shall provide a full written
     technical report to MORPHO.
     XImage is not required to send an engineer to the Kuwait site if either
     active or potentially pending hostilities exist in the region, and a
     reasonable person might fear the possibility of bodily harm.
                                                                       Page 6

                  except by a written agreement entered into by duly authorized

       statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments or modifications
       thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance department or the

       meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital ("RBC") instructions

       percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be
       agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon

       ("Moody's") and A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best"). Notwithstanding the
       obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum
       Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and

       Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand,
       which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that
       under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or
       instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is
       treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand,
       and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any
       other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which
       AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum
